abstract: 'Specifying tasks with videos is a powerful technique towards acquiring
  novel and general robot skills. However, reasoning over mechanics and dexterous
  interactions can make it challenging to scale visual learning for contact-rich manipulation.
  In this work, we focus on the problem of visual dexterous planar manipulation: given
  a video of an object in planar motion, find contact-aware robot actions that reproduce
  the same object motion. We propose a novel learning architecture that combines video
  decoding neural models with priors from contact mechanics by leveraging differentiable
  optimization and differentiable simulation. Through extensive simulated experiments,
  we investigate the interplay between traditional model-based techniques and modern
  deep learning approaches. We find that our modular and fully differentiable architecture
  outperforms learning-only methods on unseen objects and and motions. https://github.com/baceituno/dlm.'
