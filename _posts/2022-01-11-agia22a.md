abstract: 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) are an emerging description; unifying symbolic,
  topological, and metric scene representations. However, typical 3DSGs contain hundreds
  of objects and symbols even for small environments; rendering task planning on the
  \emph{full} graph impractical. We construct \textbf{Taskography}, the first large-scale
  robotic task planning benchmark over 3DSGs. While most benchmarking efforts in this
  area focus on \emph{vision-based planning}, we systematically study \emph{symbolic}
  planning, to decouple planning performance from visual representation learning.
  We observe that, among existing methods, neither classical nor learning-based planners
  are capable of real-time planning over \emph{full} 3DSGs. Enabling real-time planning
  demands progress on \emph{both} (a) sparsifying 3DSGs for tractable planning and
  (b) designing planners that better exploit 3DSG hierarchies. Towards the former
  goal, we propose \textbf{Scrub}, a task-conditioned 3DSG sparsification method;
  enabling classical planners to match (and surpass) state-of-the-art learning-based
  planners. Towards the latter goal, we propose \textbf{Seek}, a procedure enabling
  learning-based planners to exploit 3DSG structure, reducing the number of replanning
  queries required by current best approaches by an order of magnitude. We will open-source
  all code and baselines to spur further research along the intersections of robot
  task planning, learning and 3DSGs.
