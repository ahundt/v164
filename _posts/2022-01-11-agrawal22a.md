title: 'The Task Specification Problem '
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: cBdnThrYkV7
abstract: 'Robots are commonly used for several industrial applications and some have
  made their mark even in households (e.g., the roomba). Undoubtedly these systems
  are impressive! However, they are very narrow in their functionality and we are
  not even close to building a robot butler. A central challenge is the ability to
  work with sensory observations and generalization to novel situations. While we
  do not prescribe a solution to this problem, we do provide a perspective on a few
  dominant ideas in robot learning for multi-task learning and generalization. This
  perspective suggests a counter-intuitive conclusion: the primary challenge in building
  generalizable robotic systems (e.g., a robot butler) is not in the learning algorithms
  or the hardware, but in how humans transfer their knowledge to robots. '
