abstract: 'We propose a novel approach that biases actions during policy search by
  lifting the concept of redundancy resolution from multi-DoF robot kinematics to
  the level of the reward in deep reinforcement learning and evolution strategies.
  The key idea is to bias the distribution of executed actions in the sense that the
  immediate reward remains unchanged. The resulting biased actions favor secondary
  objectives yielding policies that are safer to apply on the real robot. We demonstrate
  the feasibility of our method, considered as policy search with redundant action
  bias (PSRAB), in a reaching and a pick-and-lift task with a 7-DoF Franka robot arm
  trained in RLBench - a recently introduced benchmark for robotic manipulation -
  using state-of-the-art TD3 deep reinforcement learning and OpenAIâ€™s evolutionary
  strategy. We show that it is a flexible approach without the need of significant
  fine-tuning and interference with the main objective even across different policy
  search methods and tasks of different complexity. We evaluate our approach in simulation
  and on the real robot. Our project website with videos and further results can be
