title: Dual-Arm Adversarial Robot Learning
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: FI2HrMozlo_
abstract: Robot learning is a very promising topic for the future of automation and
  machine intelligence. Future robots should be able to autonomously acquire skills,
  learn to represent their environment, and interact with it. While these topics have
  been explored in simulation, real-world robot learning research seems to be still
  limited. This is due to the additional challenges encountered in the real-world,
  such as noisy sensors and actuators, safe exploration, non-stationary dynamics,
  autonomous environment resetting as well as the cost of running experiments for
  long periods of time. Unless we develop scalable solutions to these problems, learning
  complex tasks involving hand-eye coordination and rich contacts will remain an untouched
  vision that is only feasible in controlled lab environments. We propose Dual-Arm
  settings as platforms for robot learning. Such settings enable safe data collection
  for acquiring manipulation skills as well as training perception modules in a robot-supervised
  manner. They also ease the processes of resetting the environment. Furthermore,
  adversarial learning could potentially boost the generalization capability of robot
  learning methods by maximizing the exploration based on game-theoretic objectives
  while ensuring safety based on collaborative task spaces. In this paper, we will
  discuss the potential benefits of this setup as well as the challenges and research
  directions that can be pursued.
