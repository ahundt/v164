title: 'Learning to be Multimodal : Co-evolving Sensory Modalities and Sensor Properties'
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: jaoAqmrabvO
abstract: 'Making a single sensory modality precise and robust enough to get human-level
  performance and autonomy could be very expensive or intractable. Fusing information
  from multiple sensory modalities is promising â€“ for example, recent works showed
  benefits from combining vision with haptic sensors or with audio data. Learning-based
  methods facilitate faster progress in this field by removing the need for manual
  feature engineering. However, the sensor properties and the choice of sensory modalities
  is still usually done  manually. Our blue-sky view is that we could simulate/emulate
  sensors with various properties, then infer which properties and combinations of
  sensors yield the best learning outcomes. This view would incentivize the development
  of novel, affordable sensors that can make a noticeable impact on the performance,
  robustness and ease of training classifiers, models and policies for robotics. This
  would motivate making hardware that provides signals complementary to the existing
  ones. As a result: we can significantly expand the realm of applicability of the
  learning-based approaches.'
