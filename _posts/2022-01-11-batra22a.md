abstract: We demonstrate the possibility of learning drone swarm controllers that
  are zero-shot transferable to real quadrotors via large-scale multi-agent end-to-end
  reinforcement learning. We train policies parameterized by neural networks that
  are capable of controlling individual drones in a swarm in a fully decentralized
  manner. Our policies, trained in simulated environments with realistic quadrotor
  physics, demonstrate advanced flocking behaviors, perform aggressive maneuvers in
  tight formations while avoiding collisions with each other, break and re-establish
  formations to avoid collisions with moving obstacles, and efficiently coordinate
  in pursuit-evasion tasks. We analyze, in simulation, how different model architectures
  and parameters of the training regime influence the final performance of neural
  swarms. We demonstrate the successful deployment of the model learned in simulation
  to highly resource-constrained physical quadrotors performing station keeping and
  goal swapping behaviors. Video demonstrations and source code are available at the
  project website https://sites.google.com/view/swarm-rl.
