title: Auditing Robot Learning for Safety and Compliance during Deployment
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: 57HG8dDs4t4
abstract: Robots of the future are going to exhibit increasingly human-like and super-human
  intelligence in a myriad of different tasks. They are also likely going to fail
  and be incompliant with human preferences in increasingly subtle ways. Towards the
  goal of achieving autonomous robots, the robot learning community has made rapid
  strides in applying machine learning techniques to train robots through data and
  interaction. This makes the study of how best to audit these algorithms for checking
  their compatibility with humans, pertinent and urgent. In this paper, we draw inspiration
  from the AI Safety and Alignment communities and make the case that we need to urgently
  consider ways in which we can best audit our robot learning algorithms to check
  for failure modes, and ensure that when operating autonomously, they are indeed
  behaving in ways that the human algorithm designers intend them to. We believe that
  this is a challenging problem that will require efforts from the entire robot learning
  community, and do not attempt to provide a concrete framework for auditing. Instead,
  we outline high-level guidance and a possible approach towards formulating this
  framework which we hope will serve as a useful starting point for thinking about
  auditing in the context of robot learning.
