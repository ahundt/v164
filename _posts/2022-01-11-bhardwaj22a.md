abstract: 'Sampling-based model-predictive control (MPC) is a promising tool for feedback
  control of robots with complex, non-smooth dynamics, and cost functions. However,
  the computationally demanding nature of sampling-based MPC algorithms has been a
  key bottleneck in their application to high-dimensional robotic manipulation problems
  in the real world. Previous methods have addressed this issue by running MPC in
  the task space while relying on a low-level operational space controller for joint
  control. However, by not using the joint space of the robot in the MPC formulation,
  existing methods cannot directly account for non-task space related constraints
  such as avoiding joint limits, singular configurations, and link collisions. In
  this paper, we develop a system for fast, joint space sampling-based MPC for manipulators
  that is efficiently parallelized using GPUs. Our approach can handle task and joint
  space constraints while taking less than 8msÂ (125Hz) to compute the next control
  command. Further, our method can tightly integrate perception into the control problem
  by utilizing learned cost functions from raw sensor data. We validate our approach
  by deploying it on a Franka Panda robot for a variety of dynamic manipulation tasks.
  We study the effect of different cost formulations and MPC parameters on the synthesized
  behavior and provide key insights that pave the way for the application of sampling-based
  MPC for manipulators in a principled manner. We also provide highly optimized, open-source
  code to be used by the wider robot learning and control community. Videos of experiments
