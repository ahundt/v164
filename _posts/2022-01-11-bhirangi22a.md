abstract: 'Soft sensors have continued growing interest in robotics, due to their
  ability to enable both passive conformal contact from the material properties and
  active contact data from the sensor properties. However, the same properties of
  conformal contact result in faster deterioration of soft sensors and larger variations
  in their response characteristics over time and across samples, inhibiting their
  ability to be long-lasting and replaceable. ReSkin is a tactile soft sensor that
  leverages machine learning and magnetic sensing to offer a low-cost, diverse and
  compact solution for long-term use. Magnetic sensing separates the electronic circuitry
  from the passive interface, making it easier to replace interfaces as they wear
  out while allowing for a wide variety of form factors. Machine learning allows us
  to learn sensor response models that are robust to variations across fabrication
  and time, and our self-supervised learning algorithm enables finer performance enhancement
  with small, inexpensive data collection procedures. We believe that ReSkin opens
  the door to more versatile, scalable and inexpensive tactile sensation modules than
  existing alternatives. '
