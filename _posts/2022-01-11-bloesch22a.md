title: 'Towards Real Robot Learning in the Wild: A Case Study in Bipedal Locomotion'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: 1yj7yMTtna
abstract: Algorithms for self-learning systems have made considerable progress in
  recent years, yet safety concerns and the need for additional instrumentation have
  so far largely limited learning experiments with real robots to well controlled
  lab settings. In this paper, we demonstrate how a small bipedal robot can autonomously
  learn to walk with minimal human intervention and with minimal instrumentation of
  the environment. We employ data-efficient off-policy deep reinforcement learning
  to learn to walk end-to-end, directly on hardware, using rewards that are computed
  exclusively from proprioceptive sensing. To allow the robot to autonomously adapt
  its behaviour to its environment, we additionally provide the agent with raw RGB
  camera images as input. By deploying two robots in different geographic locations
  while sharing data in a distributed learning setup, we achieve higher throughput
  and greater diversity of the training data. Our learning experiments constitute
  a step towards the long-term vision of learning “in the wild” for legged robots,
  and, to our knowledge, represent the first demonstration of learning a deep neural
  network controller for bipedal locomotion directly on hardware.
