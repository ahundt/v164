abstract: Natural language provides an accessible and expressive interface to specify
  long-term tasks for robotic agents. However, non-experts are likely to specify such
  tasks with high-level instructions, which abstract over specific robot actions through
  several layers of abstraction. We propose that key to bridging this gap between
  language and robot actions over long execution horizons are persistent representations.
  We propose a persistent spatial semantic representation method, and show how it
  enables building an agent that performs hierarchical reasoning to effectively execute
  long-term tasks. We evaluate our approach on the ALFRED benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art
  results, despite completely avoiding the commonly used step-by-step instructions.
