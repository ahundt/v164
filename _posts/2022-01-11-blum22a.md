abstract: We propose a novel robotic system that can improve its perception during
  deployment. Contrary to the established approach of learning semantics from large
  datasets and deploying fixed models, we propose a framework in which semantic models
  are continuously updated on the robot to adapt to the deployment environments. By
  combining continual learning with self-supervision, our robotic system learns online
  during deployment without external supervision. We conduct real-world experiments
  with robots localising in 3D floorplans. Our experiments show how the robot’s semantic
  perception improves during deployment and how this translates into improved localisation,
  even across drastically different environments. We further study the risk of catastrophic
  forgetting that such a continuous learning setting poses. We find memory replay
  an effective measure to reduce forgetting and show how the robotic system can improve
  even when switching between different environments. On average, our system improves
  by 60% in segmentation and 10% in localisation accuracy compared to deployment of
  a fixed model, and it maintains this improvement while adapting to further environments.
