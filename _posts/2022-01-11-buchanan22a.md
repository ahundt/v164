title: Learning Inertial Odometry for Dynamic Legged Robot State Estimation
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: a5ZiDzL0enJ
abstract: This paper introduces a novel proprioceptive state estimator for legged
  robots based on a learned displacement measurement from IMU data. Recent research
  in pedestrian tracking has shown that motion can be inferred from inertial data
  using convolutional neural networks. A learned inertial displacement measurement
  can improve state estimation in challenging scenarios where leg odometry is unreliable,
  such as slipping and compressible terrains. Our work learns to estimate a displacement
  measurement from IMU data which is then fused with traditional leg odometry. Our
  approach greatly reduces the drift of proprioceptive state estimation, which is
  critical for legged robots deployed in vision and lidar denied environments such
  as foggy sewers or dusty mines. We compared results from an EKF and an incremental
  fixed-lag factor graph estimator using data from several real robot experiments
  crossing challenging terrains. Our results show a reduction of relative pose error
  by 37% in challenging scenarios when compared to a traditional kinematic-inertial
  estimator without learned measurement. We also demonstrate a 22% reduction in error
  when used with vision systems in visually degraded environments such as an underground
  mine.
