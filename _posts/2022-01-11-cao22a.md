title: Learning Feasibility to Imitate Demonstrators with Different Dynamics
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: MWtinPDqfZg
abstract: The goal of learning from demonstrations is to learn a policy for an agent
  (imitator) by mimicking the behavior in the demonstrations.  Prior works on learning
  from demonstrations assume that the demonstrations are collected by a demonstrator
  that has the same dynamics as the imitator. However, in many real-world applications,
  this assumption is limiting â€” to improve the problem of lack of data in robotics,
  we would like to be able to leverage demonstrations collected from agents with different
  dynamics. This can be challenging as the demonstrations might not even be feasible
  for the imitator. Our insight is that we can learn a feasibility metric that captures
  the likelihood of a demonstration being feasible by the imitator. We develop a feasibility
  MDP (f-MDP) and derive the feasibility score by learning an optimal policy in the
  f-MDP. Our proposed feasibility measure encourages the imitator to learn from more
  informative demonstrations, and disregard the far from feasible demonstrations.
  Our experiments on four simulated environments and on a real robot show that the
  policy learned with our approach achieves a higher expected return than prior works.
  We show the videos of the real robot arm experiments on our website.
