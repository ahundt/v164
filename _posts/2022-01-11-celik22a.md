title: Specializing Versatile Skill Libraries using Local Mixture of Experts
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: j3Rguo81Yi_
abstract: 'A long-cherished vision in robotics is to equip robots with skills that
  match the versatility and precision of humans. For example, when playing table tennis,
  a robot should be capable of returning the ball in various ways while precisely
  placing it at the desired location.  A common approach to model such versatile behavior
  is to use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, where each expert is a contextual motion
  primitive. However, learning such MoEs is challenging as most objectives force the
  model to cover the entire context space, which prevents specialization of the primitives
  resulting in rather low-quality components.  Starting from maximum entropy reinforcement
  learning (RL), we decompose the objective into optimizing an individual lower bound
  per mixture component. Further, we introduce a curriculum by allowing the components
  to focus on a local context region, enabling the model to learn highly accurate
  skill representations. To this end, we use local context distributions that are
  adapted jointly with the expert primitives. Our lower bound advocates an iterative
  addition of new components, where new components will concentrate on local context
  regions not covered by the current MoE. This local and incremental learning results
  in a modular MoE model of high accuracy and versatility, where both properties can
  be scaled by adding more components on the fly.  We demonstrate this by an extensive
  ablation and on two challenging simulated robot skill learning tasks. We compare
  our achieved performance to LaDiPS and HiREPS, a known hierarchical policy search
  method for learning diverse skills. '
