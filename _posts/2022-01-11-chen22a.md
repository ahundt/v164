abstract: 'In-hand object reorientation has been a challenging problem in robotics
  due to high dimensional actuation space and the frequent change in contact state
  between the fingers and the objects. We present a simple model-free framework that
  can learn to reorient objects with both the hand facing upwards and downwards. We
  demonstrate the capability of reorienting over $2000$ geometrically different objects
  in both cases. The learned policies show strong zero-shot transfer performance on
  new objects. We provide evidence that these policies are amenable to real-world
  operation by distilling them to use observations easily available in the real world.
  The videos of the learned policies are available at: https://taochenshh.github.io/projects/in-hand-reorientation.'
