title: 'The Boombox: Visual Reconstruction from Acoustic Vibrations'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: DgCWxJyERoQ
abstract: Interacting with bins and containers is a fundamental task in robotics,
  making state estimation of the objects inside the bin critical.  While robots often
  use cameras for state estimation, the visual modality is not always ideal due to
  occlusions and poor illumination. We introduce The Boombox, a container that uses
  sound to estimate the state of the contents inside a box. Based on the observation
  that the collision between objects and its containers will cause an acoustic vibration,
  we present a convolutional network for learning to reconstruct visual scenes. Although
  we use low-cost and low-power contact microphones to detect the vibrations, our
  results show that learning from multimodal data enables state estimation from affordable
  audio sensors. Due to the many ways that robots use containers, we believe the box
  will have a number of applications in robotics.
