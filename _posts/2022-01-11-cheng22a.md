abstract: In this paper, we explore whether a robot can learn to regrasp a diverse
  set of objects to achieve various desired grasp poses. Regrasping is needed whenever
  a robotâ€™s current grasp pose fails to perform desired manipulation tasks. Endowing
  robots with such an ability has applications in many domains such as manufacturing
  or domestic services. Yet, it is a challenging task due to the large diversity of
  geometry in everyday objects and the high dimensionality of the state and action
  space. In this paper, we propose a system for robots to take partial point clouds
  of an object and the supporting environment as inputs and output a sequence of pick-and-place
  operations to transform an initial object grasp pose to the desired object grasp
  poses. The key technique includes a neural stable placement predictor and a regrasp
  graph based solution through leveraging and changing the surrounding environment.
  We introduce a new and challenging synthetic dataset for learning and evaluating
  the proposed approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system with
  both simulator and real-world experiments. More videos and visualization examples
  are available on our project https://sites.google.com/view/regrasp.
