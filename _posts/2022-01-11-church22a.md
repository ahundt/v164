abstract: 'Simulation has recently become key for deep reinforcement learning to safely
  and efficiently acquire general and complex control policies from visual and proprioceptive
  inputs. Tactile information is not usually considered despite its direct relation
  to environment interaction. In this work, we present a suite of simulated environments
  tailored towards tactile robotics and reinforcement learning. A simple and fast
  method of simulating optical tactile sensors is provided, where high-resolution
  contact geometry is represented as depth images. Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)
  is used to learn successful policies across all considered tasks. A data-driven
  approach enables translation of the current state of a real tactile sensor to corresponding
  simulated depth images. This policy is implemented within a real-time control loop
  on a physical robot to demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer on several
  physically-interactive tasks requiring a sense of touch. '
