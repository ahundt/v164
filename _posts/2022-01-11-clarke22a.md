abstract: Rigid objects make distinctive sounds during manipulation. These sounds
  are a function of object features, such as shape and material, and of contact forces
  during manipulation. Being able to infer from sound an object’s acoustic properties,
  how it is being manipulated, and what events it is participating in could augment
  and complement what robots can perceive from vision, especially in case of occlusion,
  low visual resolution, poor lighting, or blurred focus. Annotations on sound data
  are rare. Therefore, existing inference systems mostly include a sound renderer
  in the loop, and use analysis-by-synthesis to optimize for object acoustic properties.
  Optimizing parameters with respect to a non-differentiable renderer is slow and
  hard to scale to complex scenes. We present DiffImpact, a fully differentiable model
  for sounds rigid objects make during impacts, based on physical principles of impact
  forces, rigid object vibration, and other acoustic effects. Its differentiability
  enables gradient-based, efficient joint inference of acoustic properties of the
  objects and characteristics and timings of each individual impact. DiffImpact can
  also be plugged in as the decoder of an autoencoder, and trained end-to-end on real
  audio data, so that the encoder can learn to solve the inverse problem in a self-supervised
  way. Experiments demonstrate that our model’s physics-based inductive biases make
  it more resource efficient and expressive than state-of-the-art pure learning-based
  alternatives, on both forward rendering of impact sounds and inverse tasks such
  as acoustic property inference and blind source separation of impact sounds. Code
