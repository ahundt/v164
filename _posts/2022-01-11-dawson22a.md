title: Safe Nonlinear Control Using Robust Neural Lyapunov-Barrier Functions
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: 8K5kisAnb_p

abstract: Safety and stability are common requirements for robotic control systems;
  however, designing safe, stable controllers remains difficult for nonlinear and
  uncertain models. We develop a model-based learning approach to synthesize robust
  feedback controllers with safety and stability guarantees. We take inspiration from
  robust convex optimization and Lyapunov theory to define robust control Lyapunov
  barrier functions that generalize despite model uncertainty. We demonstrate our
  approach in simulation on problems including car trajectory tracking, nonlinear
  control with obstacle avoidance, satellite rendezvous with safety constraints, and
  flight control with a learned ground effect model. Simulation results show that
  our approach yields controllers that match or exceed the capabilities of robust
  MPC while reducing computational costs by an order of magnitude. We provide source
  code at github.com/dawsonc/neural_clbf/.
