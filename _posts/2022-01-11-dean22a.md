title: 'Robots on Demand: A Democratized Robotics Research Cloud'
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: W_TkB-1eNbs
abstract: 'Robotics research is slowed by three challenges: building a robotics lab
  is expensive (few participants), everyone uses different robots (participants’ findings
  often don’t generalize outside their lab), and there is no internet-scale robotics
  dataset (no lab has the resources to make many robots do many different tasks to
  generate data and there is no data in the wild). The solution is to build a “Robotics
  Research Cloud” consisting of centers filled with remotely operable robots in standardized
  environments. This would be a valuable resource in pushing forward robot learning
  as a field by making cutting-edge robotics research broadly accessible, helping
  the field identify promising new approaches that succeed on agreed benchmarks, and
  creating a massive real-world robotics dataset similar to those that have revolutionized
  machine learning for vision and language.'
