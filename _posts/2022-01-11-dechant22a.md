title: 'Toward robots that learn to summarize their actions in natural language: a
  set of tasks'
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: n3AW_ISWCXf
abstract: Robots should be able to report in natural language what they have done.
  They should provide concise summaries, respond to questions about them, and be able
  to learn from the natural  language  responses  they  receive to their summaries.  We
  propose that developing the capabilities for robots to summarize their actions is
  a new and necessary challenge which should be taken up by the robotic learning community.
  We propose an initial framework for robot action summarization, presented as a set
  of tasks which can serve as a target for research and a measure of progress.
