title: Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Conditioned on Lane-Graph Traversals
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: hu7b7MPCqiC
abstract: Accurately predicting the future motion of surrounding vehicles requires
  reasoning about the inherent uncertainty in driving behavior. This uncertainty can
  be loosely decoupled into lateral (e.g., keeping lane, turning) and longitudinal
  (e.g., accelerating, braking). We present a novel method that combines learned discrete
  policy rollouts with a focused decoder on subsets of the lane graph. The policy
  rollouts explore different goals given current observations, ensuring that the model
  captures lateral variability. Longitudinal variability is captured by our latent
  variable model decoder that is conditioned on various subsets of the lane graph.
  Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes motion prediction
  dataset, and qualitatively demonstrates excellent scene compliance. Detailed ablations
  highlight the importance of the policy rollouts and the decoder architecture.
