abstract: 'This work proposes an optimization-based manipulation planning framework
  where the objectives are learned functionals of signed-distance fields that represent
  objects in the scene. Most manipulation planning approaches rely on analytical models
  and carefully chosen abstractions/state-spaces to be effective. A central question
  is how models can be obtained from data that are not primarily accurate in their
  predictions, but, more importantly, enable efficient reasoning within a planning
  framework, while at the same time being closely coupled to perception spaces. We
  show that representing objects as signed-distance fields not only enables to learn
  and represent a variety of models with higher accuracy compared to point-cloud and
  occupancy measure representations, but also that SDF-based models are suitable for
  optimization-based planning. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we
  learn both kinematic and dynamic models to solve tasks that involve hanging mugs
  on hooks and pushing objects on a table. We can unify these quite different tasks
  within one framework, since SDFs are the common object representation.  Video: https://youtu.be/ga8Wlkss7co'
