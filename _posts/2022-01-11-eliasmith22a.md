title: 'Continuous then discrete: A recommendation for building robotic brains'
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: ZdghnQLpqcD
abstract: 'Modern neural networks have allowed substantial advances in robotics, but
  these algorithms make implicit assumptions about the discretization of time. In
  this document we argue that there are benefits to be gained, especially in robotics,
  by designing learning algorithms that exist in continuous time, as well as state,
  and only later discretizing the algorithms for implementation on traditional computing
  models, or mapping them directly onto analog hardware. We survey four arguments
  to support this approach: That continuum representations provide a unified theory
  of functions for robotic systems; That many algorithms formulated as temporally
  continuous demonstrate anytime properties; That we can exploit temporal sparsity
  to effect energy efficiency in both traditional and analog hardware; and that these
  algorithms reflect the instantiations of intelligence that have evolved in organisms.
  Further, we present learning algorithms that are derived from continuous representations.  Finally,
  we discuss robotic precedents for this approach, and conclude with the implications
  of using continuum representations in robotic systems.'
