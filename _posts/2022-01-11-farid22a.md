abstract: 'Our goal is to perform out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, i.e., to detect
  when a robot is operating in environments that are drawn from a different distribution
  than the environments used to train the robot. We leverage Probably Approximately
  Correct (PAC)-Bayes theory in order to train a policy with a guaranteed bound on
  performance on the training distribution. Our key idea for OOD detection then relies
  on the following intuition: violation of the performance bound on test environments
  provides evidence that the robot is operating OOD. We formalize this via statistical
  techniques based on p-values and concentration inequalities. The resulting approach
  (i) provides guaranteed confidence bounds on OOD detection, and (ii) is task-driven
  and sensitive only to changes that impact the robotâ€™s performance. We demonstrate
  our approach on a simulated example of grasping objects with unfamiliar poses or
  shapes. We also present both simulation and hardware experiments for a drone performing
  vision-based obstacle avoidance in unfamiliar environments (including wind disturbances
  and different obstacle densities). Our examples demonstrate that we can perform
  task-driven OOD detection within just a handful of trials. Comparisons with baselines
  also demonstrate the advantages of our approach in terms of providing statistical
  guarantees and being insensitive to task-irrelevant distribution shifts.'
