abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth prediction provides a cost-effective solution
  to obtain the 3D location of each pixel. However, the existing approaches usually
  lead to unsatisfactory accuracy, which is critical for autonomous robots. In this
  paper, we propose FusionDepth, a novel two-stage network to advance the self-supervised
  monocular dense depth learning by leveraging low-cost sparse (e.g. 4-beam) LiDAR.
  Unlike the existing methods that use sparse LiDAR mainly in a manner of time-consuming
  iterative post-processing, our model fuses monocular image features and sparse LiDAR
  features to predict initial depth maps. Then, an efficient feed-forward refine network
  is further designed to correct the errors in these initial depth maps in pseudo-3D
  space with real-time performance. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model
  significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, as well
  as the sparse-LiDAR-based methods on both self-supervised monocular depth prediction
  and completion tasks. With the accurate dense depth prediction, our model outperforms
  the state-of-the-art sparse-LiDAR-based method (Pseudo-LiDAR++) by more than 68%
  for the downstream task monocular 3D object detection on the KITTI Leaderboard.
