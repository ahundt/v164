title: Implicit Behavioral Cloning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: rif3a5NAxU6
abstract: 'We find that across a wide range of robot policy learning scenarios, treating
  supervised policy learning with an implicit model generally performs better, on
  average, than commonly used explicit models.  We present extensive experiments on
  this finding, and we provide both intuitive insight and theoretical arguments distinguishing
  the properties of implicit models compared to their explicit counterparts, particularly
  with respect to approximating complex, potentially discontinuous and multi-valued
  (set-valued) functions. On robotic policy learning tasks we show that implicit behavior-cloning
  policies with energy-based models (EBM) often outperform common explicit (Mean Square
  Error, or Mixture Density) behavior-cloning policies, including on tasks with high-dimensional
  action spaces and visual image inputs. We find these policies provide competitive
  results or outperform state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning methods on
  the challenging human-expert tasks from the D4RL benchmark suite, despite using
  no reward information. In the real world, robots with implicit policies can learn
  complex and remarkably subtle behaviors on contact-rich tasks from human demonstrations,
  including tasks with high combinatorial complexity and tasks requiring 1mm precision. '
