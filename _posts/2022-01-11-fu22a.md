abstract: Legged locomotion is commonly studied and expressed as a discrete set of
  gait patterns, like walk, trot, gallop, which are usually treated as given and pre-programmed
  in legged robots for efficient locomotion at different speeds. However, fixing a
  set of pre-programmed gaits limits the generality of locomotion. Recent animal motor
  studies show that these conventional gaits are only prevalent in ideal flat terrain
  conditions while real-world locomotion is unstructured and more like bouts of intermittent
  steps. What principles could lead to both structured and unstructured patterns across
  mammals and how to synthesize them in robots? In this work, we take an analysis-by-synthesis
  approach and learn to move by minimizing mechanical energy. We demonstrate that
  learning to minimize energy consumption plays a key role in the emergence of natural
  locomotion gaits at different speeds in real quadruped robots. The emergent gaits
  are structured in ideal terrains and look similar to that of horses and sheep. The
  same approach leads to unstructured gaits in rough terrains which is consistent
  with the findings in animal motor control. We validate our hypothesis in both simulation
  and real hardware across natural terrains. Videos at https://energy-locomotion.github.io
