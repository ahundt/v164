abstract: 'Autonomous robotic assembly requires a well-orchestrated sequence of high-level
  actions and smooth manipulation executions. Learning to assemble complex 3D structures
  remains a challenging problem that requires drawing connections between target designs
  and building blocks, and creating valid assembly sequences considering structural
  stability and feasibility. To address the combinatorial complexity of the assembly
  tasks, we propose a multi-head attention graph representation that can be trained
  with reinforcement learning (RL) to encode the spatial relations and provide meaningful
  assembly actions. Combining structured representations with model-free RL and Monte-Carlo
  planning allows agents to operate with various target shapes and building block
  types. We design a hierarchical control framework that learns to sequence the building
  blocks to construct arbitrary 3D designs and ensures their feasibility, as we plan
  the geometric execution with the robot-in-the-loop. We demonstrate the flexibility
  of the proposed structured representation and our algorithmic solution in a series
  of simulated 3D assembly tasks with robotic evaluation, which showcases our methodâ€™s
  ability to learn to construct stable structures with a large number of building
  blocks. Code and videos are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/learn2assemble'
