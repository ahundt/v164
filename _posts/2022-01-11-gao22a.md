  Representations'

abstract: Multisensory object-centric perception, reasoning, and interaction have
  been a key research topic in recent years. However, the progress in these directions
  is limited by the small set of objects available—synthetic objects are not realistic
  enough and are mostly centered around geometry, while real object datasets such
  as YCB are often practically challenging and unstable to acquire due to international
  shipping, inventory, and financial cost.  We present ObjectFolder, a dataset of
  100 virtualized objects that addresses both challenges with two key innovations.
  First, ObjectFolder encodes the visual, auditory, and tactile sensory data for all
  objects, enabling a number of multisensory object recognition tasks, beyond existing
  datasets that focus purely on object geometry. Second, ObjectFolder employs a uniform,
  object-centric, and implicit representation for each object’s visual textures, acoustic
  simulations, and tactile readings, making the dataset flexible to use and easy to
  share. We demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset as a testbed for multisensory
  perception and control by evaluating it on a variety of benchmark tasks, including
  instance recognition, cross-sensory retrieval, 3D reconstruction, and robotic grasping.
