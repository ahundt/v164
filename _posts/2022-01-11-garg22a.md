abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) for mobile robot global relocalization is
  a well-studied problem, where contrastive learning based representation training
  methods have led to state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods are mainly
  designed for single image based VPR, where sequential information, which is ubiquitous
  in robotics, is only used as a post-processing step for filtering single image match
  scores, but is never used to guide the representation learning process itself. In
  this work, for the first time, we bridge the gap between single image representation
  learning and sequence matching through "SeqMatchNet" which transforms the single
  image descriptors such that they become more responsive to the sequence matching
  metric. We propose a novel triplet loss formulation where the distance metric is
  based on "sequence matching", that is, the aggregation of temporal order-based Euclidean
  distances computed using single images. We use the same metric for mining negatives
  online during the training which helps the optimization process by selecting appropriate
  positives and harder negatives. To overcome the computational overhead of sequence
  matching for negative mining, we propose a 2D convolution based formulation of sequence
  matching for efficiently aggregating distances within a distance matrix computed
  using single images. We show that our proposed method achieves consistent gains
  in performance as demonstrated on four benchmark datasets. Source code available
