title: Decentralized Sharing and Valuation of Fleet Robotic Data
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: BozDOMTsSNd
abstract: 'We propose a decentralized learning framework for robots to trade, price,
  and discover valuable machine learning (ML) training data. Todayâ€™s robotic fleets,
  such as self-driving vehicles, can gather terabytes of rich video and LIDAR data
  in diverse, geo-distributed environments. Often, robots in one city or home might
  observe training data that is commonplace for them, but is actually a valuable,
  out-of-distribution (OoD) dataset to train robust ML models at robots elsewhere.
  However, simply sharing all this diverse data in cloud databases is infeasible due
  to limits on privacy and network bandwidth. Inspired by decentralized file sharing
  protocols like BitTorrent, we propose a novel system where each robot is provisioned
  with a learnable privacy filter and sharing model. Importantly, this sharing model
  attempts to predict and prioritize which sensory percepts are of high value to other
  robotic peers using a decentralized voting and feedback mechanism.  Our scheme naturally
  raises timely questions on data privacy and valuation as companies start to deploy
  robots in our homes, hospitals, and roads.  '
