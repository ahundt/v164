title: 'You Only Evaluate Once: a Simple Baseline Algorithm for Offline RL'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: GIgsuWifgIi
abstract: The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to find an optimal policy
  given prerecorded trajectories. Many current approaches customize existing off-policy
  RL algorithms, especially actor-critic algorithms in which policy evaluation and
  improvement are iterated. However, the convergence of such approaches is not guaranteed
  due to the use of complex non-linear function approximation and an intertwined optimization
  process. By contrast, we propose a simple baseline algorithm for offline RL that
  only performs the policy evaluation step once so that the algorithm does not require
  complex stabilization schemes. Since the proposed algorithm is not likely to converge
  to an optimal policy, it is an appropriate baseline for actor-critic algorithms
  that ought to be outperformed if there is indeed value in iterative optimization
  in the offline setting. Surprisingly, we empirically find that the proposed algorithm
  exhibits competitive and sometimes even state-of-the-art performance in a subset
  of the D4RL offline RL benchmark. This result suggests that future work is needed
  to fully exploit the potential advantages of iterative optimization in order to
  justify the reduced stability of such methods.
