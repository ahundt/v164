title: Tactile Image-to-Image Disentanglement of Contact Geometry from Motion-Induced
  Shear
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: 1mDC24WX8Yh
abstract: Robotic touch, particularly when using soft optical tactile sensors, suffers
  from distortion caused by motion-dependent shear. The manner in which the sensor
  contacts a stimulus is entangled with the tactile information about the stimulus
  geometry. In this work, we propose a supervised convolutional deep neural network
  model that learns to disentangle, in the latent space, the components of sensor
  deformations caused by contact geometry from those due to sliding-induced shear.
  The approach is validated by showing a close match between the unsheared images
  reconstructed from sheared images and their vertical tap (non-sheared) counterparts.
  In addition, the unsheared tactile images faithfully reconstruct the contact geometry
  masked in sheared data, and allow robust estimation of the contact pose of use for
  sliding exploration of various planar shapes. Overall, the contact geometry reconstruction
  in conjunction with sliding exploration were used for faithful full object reconstruction
  of various planar shapes. The methods have broad applicability to deep learning
  models for robots with a shear-sensitive sense of touch.
