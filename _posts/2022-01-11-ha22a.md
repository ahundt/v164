abstract: High-velocity dynamic actions (e.g., fling or throw) play a crucial role
  in our everyday interaction with deformable objects by improving our efficiency
  and effectively expanding our physical reach range. Yet, most prior works have tackled
  cloth manipulation using exclusively single-arm quasi-static actions, which requires
  a large number of interactions for challenging initial cloth configurations and
  strictly limits the maximum cloth size by the robot’s reach range. In this work,
  we demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic flinging actions for cloth unfolding
  with our proposed self-supervised learning framework, FlingBot. Our approach learns
  how to unfold a piece of fabric from arbitrary initial configurations using a pick,
  stretch, and fling primitive for a dual-arm setup from visual observations. The
  final system achieves over 80% coverage within 3 actions on novel cloths,  can unfold
  cloths larger than the system’s reach range, and generalizes to T-shirts despite
  being trained on only rectangular cloths. We also finetuned FlingBot on a real-world
  dual-arm robot platform, where it increased the cloth coverage over 4 times more
  than the quasi-static baseline did. The simplicity of FlingBot combined with its
  superior performance over quasi-static baselines demonstrates the effectiveness
  of dynamic actions for deformable object manipulation.
