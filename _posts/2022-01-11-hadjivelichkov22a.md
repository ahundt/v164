abstract: 'We address the problem of inferring self-supervised dense semantic correspondences
  between objects in multi-object scenes. The method introduces learning of class-aware
  dense object descriptors by providing either unsupervised discrete labels or confidence
  in object similarities. We quantitatively and qualitatively show that the introduced
  method outperforms previous techniques with more robust pixel-to-pixel matches.
  An example robotic application is also shownÂ - grasping of objects in clutter based
  on corresponding points. '
