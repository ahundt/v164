title: Assisted Robust Reward Design
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: vrU4d2yjjUn
abstract: 'Real-world robotic tasks require complex reward functions. When we define
  the problem the robot needs to solve, we pretend that a designer specifies this
  complex reward exactly, and it is set in stone from then on. In practice, however,
  reward design is an iterative process: the designer chooses a reward, eventually
  encounters an “edge-case” environment where the reward incentivizes the wrong behavior,
  revises the reward, and repeats. What would it mean to rethink robotics problems
  to formally account for this iterative nature of reward design? We propose that
  the robot not take the specified reward for granted, but rather have uncertainty
  about it, and account for the future design iterations as future evidence. We contribute
  an Assisted Reward Design method that speeds up the design process by anticipating
  and influencing this future evidence: rather than letting the designer eventually
  encounter failure cases and revise the reward then, the method actively exposes
  the designer to such environments during the development phase. We test this method
  in an autonomous driving task and find that it more quickly improves the car’s behavior
  in held-out environments by proposing environments that are “edge cases” for the
  current reward.'
