abstract: 'Effective robot learning often requires online human feedback and interventions
  that can cost significant human time, giving rise to the central challenge in interactive
  imitation learning: is it possible to control the timing and length of interventions
  to both facilitate learning and limit burden on the human supervisor? This paper
  presents ThriftyDAgger, an algorithm for actively querying a human supervisor given
  a desired budget of human interventions. ThriftyDAgger uses a learned switching
  policy to solicit interventions only at states that are sufficiently (1) novel,
  where the robot policy has no reference behavior to imitate, or (2) risky, where
  the robot has low confidence in task completion. To detect the latter, we introduce
  a novel metric for estimating risk under the current robot policy. Experiments in
  simulation and on a physical cable routing experiment suggest that ThriftyDAggerâ€™s
  intervention criteria balances task performance and supervisor burden more effectively
  than prior algorithms. ThriftyDAgger can also be applied at execution time, where
  it achieves a 100% success rate on both the simulation and physical tasks. A user
  study (N=10) in which users control a three-robot fleet while also performing a
  concentration task suggests that ThriftyDAgger increases human and robot performance
  by 58% and 80% respectively compared to the next best algorithm while reducing supervisor
  burden. See https://tinyurl.com/thrifty-dagger for supplementary material.'
