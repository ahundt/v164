abstract: Many real-world problems, especially in robotics, require that reinforcement
  learning (RL) agents learn policies that not only maximize an environment reward,
  but also satisfy constraints. We propose a high-level framework for solving such
  problems, that treats the environment reward and costs as separate objectives, and
  learns what preference over objectives the policy should optimize for in order to
  meet the constraints. We call this Learning Preferences and Policies in Parallel
  (LP3). By making different choices for how to learn the preference and how to optimize
  for the policy given the preference, we can obtain existing approaches (e.g., Lagrangian
  relaxation) and derive novel approaches that lead to better performance. One of
  these is an algorithm that learns a set of constraint-satisfying policies, useful
  for when we do not know the exact constraint a priori.
