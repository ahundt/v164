title: '"Good Robot! Now Watch This!": Repurposing Reinforcement Learning for Task-to-Task
  Transfer'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: Pxs5XwId51n
abstract: Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are not sample efficient to
  train on multi-step tasks in complex domains, impeding their wider deployment in
  the real world. We address this problem by leveraging the insight that RL models
  trained to complete one set of tasks can be repurposed to complete related tasks
  when given just a handful of demonstrations. Based upon this insight, we propose
  See-SPOT-Run (SSR), a new computational approach to robot learning that enables
  a robot to complete a variety of real robot tasks in novel problem domains without
  task-specific training. SSR uses pretrained RL models to create vectors that represent
  model, task, and action relevance in demonstration and test scenes. SSR then compares
  these vectors via our Cycle Consistency Distance (CCD) metric to determine the next
  action to take. SSR completes 58% more task steps and 20% more trials than a baseline
  few-shot learning method that requires task-specific training. SSR also achieves
  a four order of magnitude improvement in compute efficiency and a 20% to three order
  of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to the baseline and to training
  RL models from scratch. To our knowledge, we are the first to address multi-step
  tasks from demonstration on a real robot without task-specific training, where both
  the visual input and action space output are high dimensional. Code is available
  in the supplement.
