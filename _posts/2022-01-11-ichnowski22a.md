abstract: The ability to grasp and manipulate transparent objects is a major challenge
  for robots. Existing depth cameras have difficulty detecting, localizing, and inferring
  the geometry of such objects. We propose using neural radiance fields (NeRF) to
  detect, localize, and infer the geometry of transparent objects with sufficient
  accuracy to find and grasp them securely. We leverage NeRFâ€™s view-independent learned
  density, place lights to increase specular reflections, and perform a transparency-aware
  depth-rendering that we feed into the Dex-Net grasp planner. We show how additional
  lights create specular reflections that improve the quality of the depth map, and
  test a setup for a robot workcell equipped with an array of cameras to perform transparent
  object manipulation. We also create synthetic and real datasets of transparent objects
  in real-world settings, including singulated objects, cluttered tables, and the
  top rack of a dishwasher. In each setting we show that NeRF and Dex-Net are able
  to reliably compute robust grasps on transparent objects, achieving 90% and 100%
  grasp-success rates in physical experiments on an ABB YuMi, on objects where baseline
  methods fail.
