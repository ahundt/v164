title: Broadly-Exploring, Local-Policy Trees for Long-Horizon Task Planning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: yhy25u-DrjR
abstract: Long-horizon planning in realistic environments requires the ability to
  reason over sequential tasks in high-dimensional state spaces with complex dynamics.
  Classical motion planning algorithms, such as rapidly-exploring random trees, are
  capable of efficiently exploring large state spaces and computing long-horizon,
  sequential plans. However, these algorithms are generally challenged with complex,
  stochastic, and high-dimensional state spaces as well as in the presence of small,
  topologically complex goal regions, which naturally emerge in tasks that interact
  with the environment. Machine learning offers a promising solution for its ability
  to learn general policies that can handle complex interactions and high-dimensional
  observations. However, these policies are generally limited in horizon length. Our
  approach, Broadly-Exploring, Local-policy Trees (BELT), merges these two approaches
  to leverage the strengths of both through a task-conditioned, model-based tree search.
  BELT uses an RRT-inspired tree search to efficiently explore the state space. Locally,
  the exploration is guided by a task-conditioned, learned policy capable of performing
  general short-horizon tasks. This task space can be quite general and abstract;
  its only requirements are to be sampleable and to well-cover the space of useful
  tasks. This search is aided by a task-conditioned model that temporally extends
  dynamics propagation to allow long-horizon search and sequential reasoning over
  tasks. BELT is demonstrated experimentally to be able to plan long-horizon, sequential
  trajectories with a goal conditioned policy and generate plans that are robust.
