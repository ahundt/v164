title: Distributional Depth-Based Estimation of Object Articulation Models
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: H1-uwiTbY9z
abstract: We propose a method that efficiently learns distributions over articulation
  models directly from depth images without the need to know articulation model categories
  a priori. By contrast, existing methods that learn articulation models from raw
  observations require objects to be textured, and most only predict point estimates
  of the model parameters. Our core contributions include a novel representation for
  distributions over rigid body transformations and articulation model parameters
  based on Screw theory, von Mises-Fisher distributions and Stiefel manifolds. Combining
  these concepts allows for an efficient, mathematically sound representation that
  inherently satisfies several constraints that rigid body transformations and articulations
  must adhere to. In addition, we introduce a novel deep-learning based approach,
  DUST-net, that efficiently learns such distributions and, hence, performs category-independent
  articulation model estimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate
  our approach on two benchmarking datasets and three real-world objects and compare
  its performance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate
  that DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for
  novel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point estimates
  with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and effectively capture the uncertainty
  over predicted model parameters due to noisy inputs. [webpage]
