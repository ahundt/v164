abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of enabling a vision-based robotic manipulation
  system to generalize to novel tasks, a long-standing challenge in robot learning.
  We approach the challenge from an imitation learning perspective, aiming to study
  how scaling and broadening the data collected can facilitate such generalization.
  To that end, we develop an interactive and flexible imitation learning system that
  can learn from both demonstrations and interventions and can be conditioned on different
  forms of information that convey the task, including pre-trained embeddings of natural
  language or videos of humans performing the task. When scaling data collection on
  a real robot to more than 100 distinct tasks, we find that this system can perform
  24 unseen manipulation tasks with an average success rate of 44%, without any robot
  demonstrations for those tasks.
