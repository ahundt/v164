abstract: Bayesian optimization is a data-efficient technique which can be used for
  control parameter tuning, parametric policy adaptation, and structure design in
  robotics. Many of these problems require optimization of functions defined on non-Euclidean
  domains like spheres, rotation groups, or spaces of positive-definite matrices.
  To do so, one must place a Gaussian process prior, or equivalently define a kernel,
  on the space of interest. Effective kernels typically reflect the geometry of the
  spaces they are defined on, but designing them is generally non-trivial. Recent
  work on the Riemannian Matérn kernels, based on stochastic partial differential
  equations and spectral theory of the Laplace–Beltrami operator, offers promising
  avenues towards constructing such geometry-aware kernels. In this paper, we study
  techniques for implementing these kernels on manifolds of interest in robotics,
  demonstrate their performance on a set of artificial benchmark functions, and illustrate
  geometry-aware Bayesian optimization for a variety of robotic applications, covering
  orientation control, manipulability optimization, and  motion planning, while showing
  its improved performance.
