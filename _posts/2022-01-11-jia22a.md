title: Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction by Combining Egocentric and Allocentric Views
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: lAtePxetBNb
abstract: 'Trajectory prediction of road participants such as vehicles and pedestrians
  is crucial for autonomous driving. Recently, graph neural network (GNN) is widely
  adopted to capture the social interactions among the agents. Many GNN-based models
  formulate the prediction task as a single-agent prediction problem where multiple
  inference is needed for multi-agent prediction (which is common in practice), which
  leads to fundamental inconsistency in terms of homotopy as well as inefficiency
  for the memory and time. Moreover, even for models that do perform joint prediction,
  typically one centric agent is selected and all other agents’ information is normalized
  based on that. Such centric-only normalization leads to asymmetric encoding of different
  agents in GNN, which might harm its performance.  In this work, we propose a efficient
  multi-agent prediction framework that can predict all agents’ trajectories jointly
  by normalizing and processing all agents’ information symmetrically and homogeneously
  with combined egocentirc and allocentric views. Experiments are conducted on two
  interaction-rich behavior datasets: INTERACTION (vehicles) and TrajNet++ (pedestrian).
  The results show that the proposed framework can significantly boost the inference
  speed of the GNN-based model for multi-agent prediction and achieve better performance.
  In the INTERACTION dataset’s challenge, the proposed model achieved the 1st place
  in the regular track and generalization track.'
