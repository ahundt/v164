title: Back to Reality for Imitation Learning
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: QEG0rEN8uQS
abstract: Imitation learning, and robot learning in general, emerged due to breakthroughs
  in machine learning, rather than breakthroughs in robotics. As such, evaluation
  metrics for robot learning are deeply rooted in those for machine learning, and
  focus primarily on data efficiency. We believe that a better metric for real-world
  robot learning is time efficiency, which better models the true cost to humans.
  This is a call to arms to the robot learning community to develop our own evaluation
  metrics, tailored towards the long-term goals of real-world robotics.
