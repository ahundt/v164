abstract: General-purpose robotic systems must master a large repertoire of diverse
  skills. While reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for acquiring
  individual behaviors, the time needed to acquire each skill makes the prospect of
  a generalist robot trained with RL daunting. In this paper, we study how a large-scale
  collective robotic learning system can acquire a repertoire of behaviors simultaneously,
  sharing exploration, experience, and representations across tasks. In this framework,
  new tasks can be continuously instantiated from previously learned tasks improving
  overall performance and capabilities of the system. To instantiate this system,
  we develop a scalable and intuitive framework for specifying new tasks through user-provided
  examples of desired outcomes, devise a multi-robot collective learning system for
  data collection that simultaneously collects experience for multiple tasks, and
  develop a scalable and generalizable multi-task deep reinforcement learning method,
  which we call MT-Opt. We demonstrate how MT-Opt can learn a wide range of skills,
  including semantic picking (i.e., picking an object from a particular category),
  placing into various fixtures (e.g., placing a food item onto a plate), covering,
  aligning, and rearranging.  We train and evaluate our system on a set of 12 real-world
  tasks with data collected from 7 robots, and demonstrate the performance of our
  system both in terms of its ability to generalize to structurally similar new tasks,
  and acquire distinct new tasks more quickly by leveraging past experience.  We recommend
