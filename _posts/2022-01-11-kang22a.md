abstract: Deep reinforcement learning algorithms require large and diverse datasets
  in order to learn successful policies for perception-based mobile navigation. However,
  gathering such datasets with a single robot can be prohibitively expensive. Collecting
  data with multiple different robotic platforms with possibly different dynamics
  is a more scalable approach to large-scale data collection. But how can deep reinforcement
  learning algorithms leverage such heterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose
  a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt).
  At training time, HInt learns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test
  time, HInt integrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions
  with the integrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated
  models allows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different
  platforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot at
  test time. Our mobile navigation experiments show that HInt outperforms conventional
  hierarchical policies and single-source approaches.
