title: 'My House, My Rules: Learning Tidying Preferences with Graph Neural Networks'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: Ei3MOY2rDHB
abstract: 'Robots that arrange household objects should do so according to the user’s
  preferences, which are inherently subjective and difficult to model. We present
  NeatNet: a novel Variational Autoencoder architecture using Graph Neural Network
  layers, which can extract a low-dimensional latent preference vector from a user
  by observing how they arrange scenes. Given any set of objects, this vector can
  then be used to generate an arrangement which is tailored to that user’s spatial
  preferences, with word embeddings used for generalisation to new objects. We develop
  a tidying simulator to gather rearrangement examples from 75 users, and demonstrate
  empirically that our method consistently produces neat and personalised arrangements
  across a variety of rearrangement scenarios.'
