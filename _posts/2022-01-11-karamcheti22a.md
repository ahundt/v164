abstract: 'We introduce Language-Informed Latent Actions (LILA), a framework for learning
  natural language interfaces in the context of human-robot collaboration. LILA falls
  under the shared autonomy paradigm: in addition to providing discrete language inputs,
  humans are given a low-dimensional controller – e.g., a 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF)
  joystick that can move left/right and up/down – for operating the robot. LILA learns
  to use language to modulate this controller, providing users with a language-informed
  control space: given an instruction like "place the cereal bowl on the tray," LILA
  may learn a 2-DoF space where one dimension controls the distance from the robot’s
  end-effector to the bowl, and the other dimension controls the robot’s end-effector
  pose relative to the grasp point on the bowl. We evaluate LILA with real-world user
  studies, where users can provide a language instruction while operating a 7-DoF
  Franka Emika Panda Arm to complete a series of complex manipulation tasks. We show
  that LILA models are not only more sample efficient and performant than imitation
  learning and end-effector control baselines, but that they are also qualitatively
  preferred by users.'
