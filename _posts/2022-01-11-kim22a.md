title: Stochastic Policy Optimization with Heuristic Information for Robot Learning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: PDy45cdhiZ_
abstract: Stochastic policy-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have
  remarkably succeeded to deal with continuous control tasks. However, applying these
  methods to manipulation tasks remains a challenge since actuators of a robot manipulator
  require high dimensional continuous action spaces. In this paper, we propose exploration-bounded
  exploration actor-critic (EBE-AC), a novel deep RL approach to combine stochastic
  policy optimization with interpretable human knowledge. The human knowledge is defined
  as heuristic information based on both physical relationships between a robot and
  objects and binary signals of whether the robot has achieved certain states. The
  proposed approach, EBE-AC, combines an off-policy actor-critic algorithm with an
  entropy maximization based on the heuristic information. On a robotic manipulation
  task, we demonstrate that EBE-AC outperforms prior state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic
  deep RL algorithms in terms of sample efficiency. In addition, we found that EBE-AC
  can be easily combined with latent information, where EBE-AC with latent information
  further improved sample efficiency and robustness.
