title: 'SCAPE: Learning Stiffness Control from Augmented Position Control Experiences'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: L0tXWRrB9yw
abstract: We introduce a sample-efficient method for learning state-dependent stiffness
  control policies for dexterous manipulation. The ability to control stiffness facilitates
  safe and reliable manipulation by providing compliance and robustness to uncertainties.
  Most current reinforcement learning approaches to achieve robotic manipulation have
  exclusively focused on position control, often due to the difficulty of learning
  high-dimensional stiffness control policies. This difficulty can be partially mitigated
  via policy guidance such as imitation learning. However, expert stiffness control
  demonstrations are often expensive or infeasible to record. Therefore, we present
  an approach to learn Stiffness Control from Augmented Position control Experiences
  (SCAPE) that bypasses this difficulty by transforming position control demonstrations
  into approximate, suboptimal stiffness control demonstrations. Then, the suboptimality
  of the augmented demonstrations is addressed by using complementary techniques that
  help the agent safely learn from both the demonstrations and reinforcement learning.
  By using simulation tools and experiments on a robotic testbed, we show that the
  proposed approach efficiently learns safe manipulation policies and outperforms
  learned position control policies and several other baseline learning algorithms.
