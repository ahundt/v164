abstract: Robot manipulation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is a
  challenging problem due to the variety of shapes, materials, arrangements and lighting
  conditions.  Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust perception
  and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across various lighting conditions
  remains challenging.  To address these challenges we propose an approach to performing
  sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception.  The underlying model, SimNet, is trained
  as a single multi-headed neural network using simulated stereo data as input and
  simulated object segmentation masks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints
  and disparity as output.  A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned
  stereo sub-network that predicts disparity.  SimNet is evaluated on unknown object
  detection and deformable object keypoint detection and significantly outperforms
  a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor. By inferring grasp positions
  using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can be used to perform end-to-end
  manipulation of unknown objects across our fleet of Toyota HSR robots. In object
  grasping experiments, SimNet significantly outperforms the RBG-D baseline on optically
  challenging objects, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust manipulation of unknown
  objects, including transparent objects, in novel environments. Additional visualizations
