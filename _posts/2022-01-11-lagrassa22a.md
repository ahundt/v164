title: Learning Model Preconditions for Planning with Multiple Models
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: av44VzmMKwW
abstract: 'Different models can provide differing levels of fidelity when a robot
  is planning. Analytical models are often fast to evaluate but only work in limited
  ranges of conditions. Meanwhile, physics simulators are effective at modeling complex
  interactions between objects but are typically more computationally expensive. Learning
  when to switch between the various models can greatly improve the speed of planning
  and task success reliability. In this work, we learn model deviation estimators
  (MDEs) to predict the error between real-world states and the states outputted by
  transition models. MDEs can be used to define a model precondition that describes
  which transitions are accurately modeled. We then propose a planner that uses the
  learned model preconditions to switch between various models in order to use models
  in conditions where they are accurate, prioritizing faster models when possible.
  We evaluate our method on two real-world tasks: placing a rod into a box and placing
  a rod into a closed drawer.'
