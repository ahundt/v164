title: Parallelised Diffeomorphic Sampling-based Motion Planning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: WFqkGvBy78
abstract: We propose Parallelised Diffeomorphic Sampling-based Motion Planning (PDMP).
  PDMP is a novel parallelised framework that uses bijective and differentiable mappings,
  or diffeomorphisms, to transform sampling distributions of sampling-based motion
  planners, in a manner akin to normalising flows. Unlike normalising flow models
  which use invertible neural network structures to represent these diffeomorphisms,
  we develop them from gradient information of desired costs, and encode desirable
  behaviour, such as obstacle avoidance. These transformed sampling distributions
  can then be used for sampling-based motion planning. A particular example is when
  we wish to imbue the sampling distribution with knowledge of the environment geometry,
  such that drawn samples are less prone to be in collision. To this end, we propose
  to learn a continuous occupancy representation from environment occupancy data,
  such that gradients of the representation defines a valid diffeomorphism and is
  amenable to fast parallelise evaluation. We use this to “morph” the sampling distribution
  to draw far less collision-prone samples. PDMP is able to leverage gradient information
  of costs, to inject specifications, in a manner similar to optimisation-based motion
  planning methods, but relies on drawing from a sampling distribution, retaining
  the tendency to find more global solutions, thereby bridging the gap between trajectory
  optimisation and sampling-based planning methods.
