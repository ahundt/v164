abstract: Skill chaining is a promising approach for synthesizing complex behaviors
  by sequentially combining previously learned skills. Yet, a naive composition of
  skills fails when a policy encounters a starting state never seen during its training.
  For successful skill chaining, prior approaches attempt to widen the policyâ€™s starting
  state distribution. However, these approaches require larger state distributions
  to be covered as more policies are sequenced, and thus are limited to short skill
  sequences. In this paper, we propose to chain multiple policies without excessively
  large initial state distributions by regularizing the terminal state distributions
  in an adversarial learning framework. We evaluate our approach on two complex long-horizon
  manipulation tasks of furniture assembly. Our results have shown that our method
  establishes the first model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to solve these
  tasks; whereas prior skill chaining approaches fail. The code and videos are available
  at https://clvrai.com/skill-chaining.
