abstract: We study the problem of robotic stacking with objects of complex geometry.
  We propose a challenging and diverse set of such objects that was carefully designed
  to require strategies beyond a simple “pick-and-place” solution. Our method is a
  reinforcement learning (RL) approach combined with vision-based interactive policy
  distillation and simulation-to-reality transfer. Our learned policies can efficiently
  handle multiple object combinations in the real world and exhibit a large variety
  of stacking skills. In a large experimental study, we investigate what choices matter
  for learning such general vision-based agents in simulation, and what affects optimal
  transfer to the real robot. We then leverage data collected by such policies and
  improve upon them with offline RL. A video and a blog post of our work are provided
  as supplementary material.
