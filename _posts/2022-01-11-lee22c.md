title: Trust Your Robots! Predictive Uncertainty Estimation of Neural Networks with
  Sparse Gaussian Processes
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: eIk6eBz3Wlt
abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic framework to obtain both reliable and
  fast uncertainty estimates for predictions with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Our
  main contribution is a practical and principled combination of DNNs with sparse
  Gaussian Processes (GPs). We prove theoretically that DNNs can be seen as a special
  case of sparse GPs, namely mixtures of GP experts (MoE-GP), and we devise a learning
  algorithm that brings the derived theory into practice. In experiments from two
  different robotic tasks – inverse dynamics of a manipulator and object detection
  on a micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) – we show the effectiveness of our approach in terms
  of predictive uncertainty, improved scalability, and run-time efficiency on a Jetson
  TX2. We thus argue that our approach can pave the way towards reliable and fast
  robot learning systems with uncertainty awareness.
