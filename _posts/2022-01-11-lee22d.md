abstract: 'Recent advance in deep offline reinforcement learning (RL) has made it
  possible to train strong robotic agents from offline datasets. However, depending
  on the quality of the trained agents and the application being considered, it is
  often desirable to fine-tune such agents via further online interactions. In this
  paper, we observe that state-action distribution shift may lead to severe bootstrap
  error during fine-tuning, which destroys the good initial policy obtained via offline
  RL. To address this issue, we first propose a balanced replay scheme that prioritizes
  samples encountered online while also encouraging the use of near-on-policy samples
  from the offline dataset. Furthermore, we leverage multiple Q-functions trained
  pessimistically offline, thereby preventing overoptimism concerning unfamiliar actions
  at novel states during the initial training phase. We show that the proposed method
  improves sample-efficiency and final performance of the fine-tuned robotic agents
  on various locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/shlee94/Off2OnRL.'
