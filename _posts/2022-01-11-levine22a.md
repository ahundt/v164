openreview: L55-yn1iwrm
abstract: The recent history of machine learning research has taught us that machine
  learning methods can be most effective when they are provided with very large, high-capacity
  models, and trained on very large and diverse datasets. This has spurred the community
  to search for ways to remove any bottlenecks to scale. Often the foremost among
  such bottlenecks is the need for human effort, including the effort of curating
  and labeling datasets. As a result, considerable attention in recent years has been
  devoted to utilizing unlabeled data, which can be collected in vast quantities.
  However, some of the most widely used methods for training on such unlabeled data
  themselves require human-designed objective functions that must correlate in some
  meaningful way to downstream tasks. I will argue that a general, principled, and
  powerful framework for utilizing unlabeled data can be derived from reinforcement
  learning, using general purpose unsupervised or self-supervised reinforcement learning
  objectives in concert with offline reinforcement learning methods that can leverage
  large datasets. I will discuss how such a procedure is more closely aligned with
  potential downstream tasks, and how it could build on existing techniques that have
  been developed in recent years.
