abstract: 'Recent research in embodied AI has been boosted by the use of simulation
  environments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use of
  simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics simulators
  can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0, an open-source
  simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more diverse set of household
  tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson 2.0 supports object states,
  including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness level, and toggled and sliced
  states, necessary to cover a wider range of tasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements
  a set of predicate logic functions that map the simulator states to logic states
  like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally, given a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample
  valid physical states that satisfy it. This functionality can generate potentially
  infinite instances of tasks with minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism
  allows our scenes to be more densely populated with small objects in semantically
  meaningful locations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface
  to immerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can collect
  demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them for imitation
  learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to enable robot learning
  of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the potential of this new simulator
  to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson 2.0 and its new dataset are publicly
  available at http://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/.'
