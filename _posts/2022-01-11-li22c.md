title: Learning A Risk-Aware Trajectory Planner From Demonstrations Using Logic Monitor
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: Q9VHQw594zx
abstract: 'Risk awareness is an important factor to consider when deploying policies
  on robots in the real-world. Defining the right set of risk metrics can be difficult.
  In this work, we use a differentiable logic monitor that keeps track of the environmental
  agents’ behaviors and provides a risk metric that the controlled agent can incorporate
  during planning. We introduce LogicRiskNet, a learning structure that can be constructed
  from temporal logic formulas describing rules governing a safe agent’s behaviors.
  The network’s parameters can be learned from demonstration data. By using temporal
  logic, the network provides an interpretable architecture that can explain what
  risk metrics are important to the human.  We integrate LogicRiskNet in an inverse
  optimal control (IOC) framework and show that we can learn to generate trajectory
  plans that accurately mimic the expert’s risk handling behaviors solely from demonstration
  data. We evaluate our method on a real-world driving dataset. '
