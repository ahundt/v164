title: 'Dealing with the Unknown: Pessimistic Offline Reinforcement Learning'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: ftOqDUeLPn3
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown effective in domains where the
  agent can learn policies by actively interacting with its operating environment.
  However, if we change the RL scheme to offline setting where the agent can only
  update its policy via static datasets, one of the major issues in offline reinforcement
  learning emerges, i.e. distributional shift. We propose a Pessimistic Offline Reinforcement
  Learning (PessORL) algorithm to actively lead the agent back to the area where it
  is familiar by manipulating the value function. We focus on problems caused by out-of-distribution
  (OOD) states, and deliberately penalize high values at states that are absent in
  the training dataset, so that the learned pessimistic value function lower bounds
  the true value anywhere within the state space. We evaluate the PessORL algorithm
  on various benchmark tasks, where we show that our method gains better performance
  by explicitly handling OOD states, when compared to those methods merely considering
  OOD actions.
