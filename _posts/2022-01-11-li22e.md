abstract: Semantic scene graph provides an effective way for intelligent agents to
  better understand the environment and it has been extensively used in many robotic
  applications. Existing work mainly focuses on generating the scene graph from the
  sensory information collected from a pre-defined path, while the environment should
  be exhaustively explored with a carefully designed path in order to obtain a comprehensive
  semantic scene graph efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new task of Embodied
  Semantic Scene Graph Generation, which exploits the embodiment of the intelligent
  agent to autonomously generate an appropriate path to explore the environment for
  scene graph generation. To this end, a learning framework with the paradigms of
  imitation learning and reinforcement learning is proposed to help the agent generate
  proper actions to explore the environment and the scene graph is incrementally constructed.
  The proposed method is evaluated on the AI2Thor environment using both the quantitative
  and qualitative performance indexes. Additionally, we implement the proposed method
  on a streaming video captioning task and promising experimental results are achieved.
