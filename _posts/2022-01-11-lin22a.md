abstract: Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging due to the complex dynamics
  of cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation, and self-occlusions. In
  contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn a pixel-based dynamics model
  or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose to learn a particle-based dynamics
  model from a partial point cloud observation. To overcome the challenges of partial
  observability, we infer which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth
  mesh.  We then learn a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared
  to previous learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with
  its particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it
  can generalize to cloths with novel shapes; it is invariant to visual features;
  and the predictions can be more easily visualized. We show that our method greatly
  outperforms previous state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning
  methods in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer
  where we deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the
  model can successfully smooth cloths of different materials, geometries and colors
  from crumpled configurations. Videos can be found in the supplement and on our anonymous
  project website.
