title: Legged Robot State Estimation using Invariant Kalman Filtering and Learned
  Contact Events
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: yt3tDB67lc5
software: https://github.com/UMich-CURLY/deep-contact-estimator
abstract: This work develops a learning-based contact estimator for legged robots
  that bypasses the need for physical sensors and takes multi-modal proprioceptive
  sensory data as input. Unlike vision-based state estimators, proprioceptive state
  estimators are agnostic to perceptually degraded situations such as dark or foggy
  scenes. While some robots are equipped with dedicated physical sensors to detect
  necessary contact data for state estimation, some robots do not have dedicated contact
  sensors, and the addition of such sensors is non-trivial without redesigning the
  hardware. The trained network can estimate contact events on different terrains.
  The experiments show that a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter can generate
  accurate odometry trajectories compared to a state-of-the-art visual SLAM system,
  enabling robust proprioceptive odometry.
