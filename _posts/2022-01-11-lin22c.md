abstract: We propose RoboFlow,  a cloud-based workflow management system orchestrating
  the pipelines of developing AI-enhanced robots. Unlike most traditional robotic
  development processes that are essentially process-centric, RoboFlow is data-centric.
  This striking property makes it especially suitable for developing AI-enhanced robots
  in which data play a central role. More specifically, RoboFlow models the whole
  robotic development process into 4 building modules (1. data processing, 2. algorithmic
  development, 3. back testing and 4. application adaptation) interacting with a centralized
  data engine. All these building modules are containerized and orchestrated under
  a unified interfacing framework. Such an architectural design greatly increases
  the maintainability and re-usability of all the building modules and enables us
  to develop them in a fully parallel fashion. To demonstrate the efficacy of the
  developed system, we exploit it to develop two prototype systems named “Egomobility"
  and “Egoplan". Egomobility provides general-purpose navigation functionalities for
  a wide variety of mobile robots and Egoplan solves path planning problems in high
  dimensional continuous state and action spaces for robot arms. Our result shows
  that RoboFlow can significantly streamline the whole development lifecycle and the
  same workflow is applicable to numerous intelligent robotic applications.
