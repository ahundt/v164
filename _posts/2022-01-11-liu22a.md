section: Contributed Papers
openreview: wMoHIYBsj2_
abstract: Manipulating articulated objects requires multiple robot arms in general.
  It is challenging to enable multiple robot arms to collaboratively complete manipulation
  tasks on articulated objects. In this paper, we present V-MAO, a framework for learning
  multi-arm manipulation of articulated objects. Our framework includes a variational
  generative model that learns contact point distribution over object rigid parts
  for each robot arm. The training signal is obtained from interaction with the simulation
  environment which is enabled by planning and a novel formulation of object-centric
  control for articulated objects. We deploy our framework in a customized MuJoCo
  simulation environment and demonstrate that our framework achieves a high success
  rate on six different objects and two different robots. We also show that generative
  modeling can effectively learn the contact point distribution on articulated objects.
