abstract: Learning complex manipulation tasks in realistic, obstructed environments
  is a challenging problem due to hard exploration in the presence of obstacles and
  high-dimensional visual observations. Prior work tackles the exploration problem
  by integrating motion planning and reinforcement learning. However, the motion planner
  augmented policy requires access to state information, which is often not available
  in the real-world settings. To this end, we propose to distill a state-based motion
  planner augmented policy to a visual control policy via (1) visual behavioral cloning
  to remove the motion planner dependency along with its jittery motion, and (2) vision-based
  reinforcement learning with the guidance of the smoothed trajectories from the behavioral
  cloning agent. We evaluate our method on three manipulation tasks in obstructed
  environments and compare it against various reinforcement learning and imitation
  learning baselines. The results demonstrate that our framework is highly sample-efficient
  and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, coupled with domain randomization,
  our policy is capable of zero-shot transfer to unseen environment settings with
  distractors. Code and videos are available at https://clvrai.com/mopa-pd.
