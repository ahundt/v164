abstract: Reinforcement learning in robotics is extremely challenging due to many
  practical issues, including safety, mechanical constraints, and wear and tear. Typically,
  these issues are not considered in the machine learning literature. One crucial
  problem in applying reinforcement learning in the real world is Safe Exploration,
  which requires physical and safety constraints satisfaction throughout the learning
  process.  To explore in such a safety-critical environment, leveraging known information
  such as robot models and constraints is beneficial to provide more robust safety
  guarantees. Exploiting this knowledge, we propose a novel method to learn robotics
  tasks in simulation efficiently while satisfying the constraints during the learning
  process.
