abstract: 'Robotic skills can be learned via imitation learning (IL) using user-provided
  demonstrations, or via reinforcement learning (RL) using large amounts of autonomously
  collected experience. Both methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses:
  RL can reach a high level of performance, but requires exploration, which can be
  very time consuming and unsafe; IL does not require exploration, but only learns
  skills that are as good as the provided demonstrations. Can a single method combine
  the strengths of both approaches? A number of prior methods have aimed to address
  this question, proposing a variety of techniques that integrate elements of IL and
  RL. However, scaling up such methods to complex robotic skills that integrate diverse
  offline data and generalize meaningfully to real-world scenarios still presents
  a major challenge. In this paper, our aim is to test the scalability of prior IL
  + RL algorithms and devise a system based on detailed empirical experimentation
  that combines existing components in the most effective and scalable way.  To that
  end, we present a series of experiments aimed at understanding the implications
  of each design decision, so as to develop a combined approach that can utilize demonstrations
  and heterogeneous prior data to attain the best performance on a range of real-world
  and realistic simulated robotic problems. Our complete method, which we call AW-Opt,
  combines elements of advantage-weighted regression and QT-Opt, providing a unified
  approach for integrating demonstrations and offline data for robotic manipulation.
