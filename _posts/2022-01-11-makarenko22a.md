title: Aligning an optical interferometer with beam divergence control and continuous
  action space

abstract: Reinforcement learning is finding its way to real-world problem application,
  transferring from simulated environments to physical setups. In this work, we implement
  vision-based alignment of an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a confocal
  telescope in one arm, which controls the diameter and divergence of the corresponding
  beam.  We use a continuous action space; exponential scaling enables us to handle
  actions within a range of over two orders of magnitude. Our agent trains only in
  a simulated environment with domain randomizations. In an experimental evaluation,
  the agent significantly outperforms an existing solution and a human expert.
