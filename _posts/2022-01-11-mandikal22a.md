abstract: Dexterous multi-fingered robotic hands have a formidable action space, yet
  their morphological similarity to the human hand holds immense potential to accelerate
  robot learning. We propose DexVIP, an approach to learn dexterous robotic grasping
  from human-object interactions present in in-the-wild YouTube videos. We do this
  by curating grasp images from human-object interaction videos and imposing a prior
  over the agent’s hand pose when learning to grasp with deep reinforcement learning.
  A key advantage of our method is that the learned policy is able to leverage free-form
  in-the-wild visual data.  As a result, it can easily scale  to new objects, and
  it sidesteps the standard practice of collecting human demonstrations in a lab—a
  much more expensive and indirect way to capture human expertise. Through experiments
  on 27 objects with a 30-DoF simulated robot hand, we demonstrate that DexVIP compares
  favorably to existing approaches that lack a hand pose prior or rely on specialized
  tele-operation equipment to obtain human demonstrations, while also being faster
  to train.
