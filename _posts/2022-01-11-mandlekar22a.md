abstract: Imitating human demonstrations is a promising approach to endow robots with
  various manipulation capabilities. While recent advances have been made in imitation
  learning and batch (offline) reinforcement learning, a lack of open-source human
  datasets and reproducible learning methods make assessing the state of the field
  difficult. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of six offline learning
  algorithms for robot manipulation on five simulated and three real-world multi-stage
  manipulation tasks of varying complexity, and with datasets of varying quality.
  Our study analyzes the most critical challenges when learning from offline human
  data for manipulation. Based on the study, we derive a series of lessons including
  the sensitivity to different algorithmic design choices, the dependence on the quality
  of the demonstrations, and the variability based on the stopping criteria due to
  the different objectives in training and evaluation. We also highlight opportunities
  for learning from human datasets, such as the ability to learn proficient policies
  on challenging, multi-stage tasks beyond the scope of current reinforcement learning
  methods, and the ability to easily scale to natural, real-world manipulation scenarios
  where only raw sensory signals are available. We have open-sourced our datasets
  and all algorithm implementations to facilitate future research and fair comparisons
