title: Guided Imitation of Task and Motion Planning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: "-JwmfQC6IRt"
abstract: 'While modern policy optimization methods can do complex manipulation from
  sensory data, they struggle on problems with extended time horizons and multiple
  sub-goals. On the other hand, task and motion planning (TAMP) methods scale to long
  horizons but they are computationally expensive and need to precisely track world
  state. We propose a method that draws on the strength of both methods: we train
  a policy to imitate a TAMP solverâ€™s output. This produces a feed-forward policy
  that can accomplish multi-step tasks from sensory data. First, we build an asynchronous
  distributed TAMP solver that can produce supervision data fast enough for imitation
  learning. Then, we propose a hierarchical policy architecture that lets us use partially
  trained control policies to speed up the TAMP solver. In robotic manipulation tasks
  with 7-DoF joint control, the partially trained policies reduce the time needed
  for planning by a factor of up to 2.6. Among these tasks, we can learn a policy
  that solves the RoboSuite 4-object pick-place task 88% of the time from object pose
  observations and a policy that solves the RoboDesk 9-goal benchmark 79% of the time
  from RGB images (averaged across the 9 disparate tasks).'
