title: Learning Density Distribution of Reachable States for Autonomous Systems
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: sWBqOL5Nh4P
abstract: State density distribution, in contrast to worst-case reachability, can
  be leveraged for safety-related problems to better quantify the likelihood of the
  risk for potentially hazardous situations. In this work, we propose a data-driven
  method to compute the density distribution of reachable states for nonlinear and
  even black-box systems. Our semi-supervised approach learns system dynamics and
  the state density jointly from trajectory data, guided by the fact that the state
  density evolution follows the Liouville partial differential equation. With the
  help of neural network reachability tools, our approach can estimate the set of
  all possible future states as well as their density. Moreover, we could perform
  online safety verification with probability ranges for unsafe behaviors to occur.
  We use an extensive set of experiments to show that our learned solution can produce
  a much more accurate estimate on density distribution, and can quantify risks less
  conservatively and flexibly comparing with worst-case analysis.
