abstract: Exploiting past 3D LiDAR scans to predict future point clouds is a promising
  method for autonomous mobile systems to realize foresighted state estimation, collision
  avoidance, and planning. In this paper, we address the problem of predicting future
  3D LiDAR point clouds given a sequence of past LiDAR scans. Estimating the future
  scene on the sensor level does not require any preceding steps as in localization
  or tracking systems and can be trained self-supervised. We propose an end-to-end
  approach that exploits a 2D range image representation of each 3D LiDAR scan and
  concatenates a sequence of range images to obtain a 3D tensor. Based on such tensors,
  we develop an encoder-decoder architecture using 3D convolutions to jointly aggregate
  spatial and temporal information of the scene and to predict the future 3D point
  clouds. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and the experimental results
  suggest that our method outperforms existing point cloud prediction architectures
  and generalizes well to new, unseen environments without additional fine-tuning.
  Our method operates online and is faster than the common LiDAR frame rate of 10
  Hz.
