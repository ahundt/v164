title: IMU-Assisted Learning of Single-View Rolling Shutter Correction
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: Pp0Co2vU28N

abstract: Rolling shutter distortion is highly undesirable for photography and computer
  vision algorithms (e.g., visual SLAM) because pixels can be potentially captured
  at different times and poses. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network to
  predict depth and row-wise pose from a single image for rolling shutter correction.
  Our contribution in this work is to incorporate inertial measurement unit (IMU)
  data into the pose refinement process, which, compared to the state-of-the-art,
  greatly enhances the pose prediction. The improved accuracy and robustness make
  it possible for numerous vision algorithms to use imagery captured by rolling shutter
  cameras and produce highly accurate results. We also extend a dataset to have real
  rolling shutter images, IMU data, depth maps, camera poses, and corresponding global
  shutter images for rolling shutter correction training. We demonstrate the efficacy
  of the proposed method by evaluating the performance of Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO)
  algorithm on rolling shutter imagery corrected using the proposed approach. Results
  show marked improvements of the DSO algorithm over using uncorrected imagery, validating
  the proposed approach.
