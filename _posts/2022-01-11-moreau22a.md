title: 'LENS: Localization enhanced by NeRF synthesis'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: YFF73MRGUIH
abstract: 'Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently demonstrated photorealistic
  results for the task of novel view synthesis. In this paper, we propose to apply
  novel view synthesis to the robot relocalization problem: we demonstrate improvement
  of camera pose regression thanks to an additional synthetic dataset rendered by
  the NeRF class of algorithm. To avoid spawning novel views in irrelevant places
  we selected virtual camera locations from NeRF internal representation of the 3D
  geometry of the scene. We further improved localization accuracy of pose regressors
  using synthesized realistic and geometry consistent images as data augmentation
  during training. At the time of publication, our approach improved state of the
  art with a 60% lower error on Cambridge Landmarks and 7-scenes datasets. Hence,
  the resulting accuracy becomes comparable to structure-based methods, without any
  architecture modification or domain adaptation constraints. Since our method allows
  almost infinite generation of training data, we investigated limitations of camera
  pose regression depending on size and distribution of data used for training on
  public benchmarks. We concluded that pose regression accuracy is mostly bounded
  by relatively small and biased datasets rather than capacity of the pose regression
  model to solve the localization task.'
