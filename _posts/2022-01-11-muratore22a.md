title: Neural Posterior Domain Randomization
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: 59aUaAbVfMA
abstract: Combining domain randomization and reinforcement learning is a widely used
  approach to obtain control policies that can bridge the gap between simulation and
  reality. However, existing methods make limiting assumptions on the form of the
  domain parameter distribution which prevents them from utilizing the full power
  of domain randomization. Typically, a restricted family of probability distributions
  (e.g., normal or uniform) is chosen a priori for every parameter. Furthermore, straightforward
  approaches based on deep learning require differentiable simulators, which are either
  not available or can only simulate a limited class of systems. Such rigid assumptions
  diminish the applicability of domain randomization in robotics. Building upon recently
  proposed neural likelihood-free inference methods, we introduce Neural Posterior
  Domain Randomization (NPDR), an algorithm that alternates between learning a policy
  from a randomized simulator and adapting the posterior distribution over the simulatorâ€™s
  parameters in a Bayesian fashion. Our approach only requires a parameterized simulator,
  coarse prior ranges, a policy (optionally with optimization routine), and a small
  set of real-world observations. Most importantly, the domain parameter distribution
  is not restricted to a specific family, parameters can be correlated, and the simulator
  does not have to be differentiable. We show that the presented method is able to
  efficiently adapt the posterior over the domain parameters to closer match the observed
  dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that NPDR can learn transferable policies using
  fewer real-world rollouts than comparable algorithms.
