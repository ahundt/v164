title: Learning Backchanneling Behaviors for a Social Robot via Data Augmentation
  from Human-Human Conversations

abstract: Backchanneling behaviors on a robot, such as nodding, can make talking to
  a robot feel more natural and engaging by giving a sense that the robot is actively
  listening. For backchanneling to be effective, it is important that the timing of
  such cues is appropriate given the humansâ€™ conversational behaviors. Recent progress
  has shown that these behaviors can be learned from datasets of human-human conversations.
  However, recent data-driven methods tend to overfit to the human speakers that are
  seen in training data and fail to generalize well to previously unseen speakers.
  In this paper, we explore the use of data augmentation for effective nodding behavior
  in a robot. We show that, by augmenting the input speech and visual features, we
  can produce data-driven models that are more robust to unseen features without collecting
  additional data. We analyze the efficacy of data-driven backchanneling in a realistic
  human-robot conversational setting with a user study, showing that users perceived
  the data-driven model to be better at listening as compared to rule-based and random
  baselines.
