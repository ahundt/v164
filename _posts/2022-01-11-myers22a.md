abstract: Learning from human feedback has shown to be a useful approach in acquiring
  robot reward functions. However, expert feedback is often assumed to be drawn from
  an underlying unimodal reward function. This assumption does not always hold including
  in settings where multiple experts provide data or when a single expert provides
  data for different tasks—we thus go beyond learning a unimodal reward and focus
  on learning a multimodal reward function. We formulate the multimodal reward learning
  as a mixture learning problem and develop a novel ranking-based learning approach,
  where the experts are only required to rank a given set of trajectories. Furthermore,
  as access to interaction data is often expensive in robotics, we develop an active
  querying approach to accelerate the learning process. We conduct experiments and
  user studies using a multi-task variant of OpenAI’s LunarLander and a real Fetch
  robot, where we collect data from multiple users with different preferences. The
  results suggest that our approach can efficiently learn multimodal reward functions,
  and improve data-efficiency over benchmark methods that we adapt to our learning
  problem.
