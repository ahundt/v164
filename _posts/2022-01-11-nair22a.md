abstract: 'We study the problem of learning a range of vision-based manipulation tasks
  from a large offline dataset of robot interaction. In order to accomplish this,
  humans need easy and effective ways of specifying tasks to the robot. Goal images
  are one popular form of task specification, as they are already grounded in the
  robot’s observation space. However, goal images also have a number of drawbacks:
  they are inconvenient for humans to provide, they can over-specify the desired behavior
  leading to a sparse reward signal, or under-specify task information in the case
  of non-goal reaching tasks. Natural language provides a convenient and flexible
  alternative for task specification, but comes with the challenge of grounding language
  in the robot’s observation space. To scalably learn this grounding we propose to
  leverage offline pre-collected robotic datasets (including highly sub-optimal, autonomously-collected
  data) with crowd-sourced natural language labels. With this data, we learn a simple
  classifier which predicts if a change in state completes a language instruction.
  This provides a language-conditioned reward function that can then be used for offline
  multi-task RL. In our experiments, we find that on language-conditioned manipulation
  tasks our approach outperforms both goal-image specifications and language conditioned
  imitation techniques by more than 25%,  and is able to perform a range of visuomotor
  tasks from natural language, such as “open the right drawer” and “move the stapler”,
  on a Franka Emika Panda robot.'
