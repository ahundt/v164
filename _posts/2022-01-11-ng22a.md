title: Generalised Task Planning with First-Order Function Approximation
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: DCfV0wDvtoV
abstract: Real world robotics often operates in uncertain and dynamic environments
  where generalisation over different scenarios is of practical interest. In the absence
  of a model, value-based reinforcement learning can be used to learn a goal-directed
  policy. Typically, the interaction between robots and the objects in the environment
  exhibit a first-order structure. We introduce first-order, or relational, features
  to represent an approximation of the Q-function so that it can induce a generalised
  policy. Empirical results for a service robot domain show that our online relational
  reinforcement learning method is scalable to large scale problems and enables transfer
  learning between different problems and simulation environments with dissimilar
  transition dynamics.
