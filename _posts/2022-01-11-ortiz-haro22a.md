title: Structured deep generative models for sampling on constraint manifolds in sequential
  manipulation
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: CPbn4N3a2zC
abstract: 'Sampling efficiently on constraint manifolds is a core problem in robotics.
  We propose Deep Generative Constraint Sampling (DGCS), which combines a deep generative
  model for sampling close to a constraint manifold with nonlinear constrained optimization
  to project to the constraint manifold. The generative model is conditioned on the
  problem instance, taking a scene image as input, and it is trained with a dataset
  of solutions and a novel analytic constraint term. To further improve the precision
  and diversity of samples, we extend the approach to exploit a factorization of the
  constrained problem. We evaluate our approach in two problems of robotic sequential
  manipulation in cluttered environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our
  deep generative model produces diverse and precise samples and outperforms heuristic
  warmstart initialization. '
