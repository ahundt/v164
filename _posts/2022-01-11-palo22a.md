title: Learning Multi-Stage Tasks with One Demonstration via Self-Replay
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: p-TBwVowXRH
abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel method to learn everyday-like multi-stage
  tasks from a single human demonstration, without requiring any prior object knowledge.
  Inspired by the recent Coarse-to-Fine Imitation Learning, we model imitation learning
  as a learned object reaching phase followed by an open-loop replay of the operatorâ€™s
  actions. We build upon this for multi-stage tasks where, following the human demonstration,
  the robot can autonomously collect image data for the entire multi-stage task, by
  reaching the next object in the sequence and then replaying the demonstration, repeating
  in a loop for all stages of the task. We evaluate with real-world experiments on
  a set of everyday multi-stage tasks, which we show that our method can solve from
  a single demonstration. Videos and supplementary material can be found at this webpage.
