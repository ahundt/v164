title: Predicting Stable Configurations for Semantic Placement of Novel Objects
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: 5DjX89Wyhk-
abstract: 'Human environments contain numerous objects configured in a variety of
  arrangements. Our goal is to enable robots to repose previously unseen objects according
  to learned semantic relationships in novel environments. We break this problem down
  into two parts: (1) finding physically valid locations for the objects and (2) determining
  if those poses satisfy learned, high-level semantic relationships. We build our
  models and training from the ground up to be tightly integrated with our proposed
  planning algorithm for semantic placement of unknown objects. We train our models
  purely in simulation, with no fine-tuning needed for use in the real world. Our
  approach enables motion planning for semantic rearrangement of unknown objects in
  scenes with varying geometry from only RGB-D sensing. Our experiments through a
  set of simulated ablations demonstrate that using a relational classifier alone
  is not sufficient for reliable planning. We further demonstrate the ability of our
  planner to generate and execute diverse manipulation plans through a set of real-world
  experiments with a variety of objects.'
