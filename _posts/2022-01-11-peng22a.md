abstract: 'When learning common skills like driving, beginners usually have domain
  experts standing by to ensure the safety of the learning process. We formulate such
  learning scheme under the Expert-in-the-loop Reinforcement Learning where a guardian
  is introduced to safeguard the exploration of the learning agent. While allowing
  the sufficient exploration in the uncertain environment, the guardian intervenes
  under dangerous situations and demonstrates the correct actions to avoid potential
  accidents. Thus ERL enables both exploration and expertâ€™s partial demonstration
  as two training sources. Following such a setting, we develop a novel Expert Guided
  Policy Optimization (EGPO) method which integrates the guardian in the loop of reinforcement
  learning. The guardian is composed of an expert policy to generate demonstration
  and a switch function to decide when to intervene. Particularly, a constrained optimization
  technique is used to tackle the trivial solution that the agent deliberately behaves
  dangerously to deceive the expert into taking over. Offline RL technique is further
  used to learn from the partial demonstration generated by the expert. Safe driving
  experiments show that our method achieves superior training and test-time safety,
  outperforms baselines with a substantial margin in sample efficiency, and preserves
  the generalizabiliy to unseen environments in test-time. Demo video and source code
