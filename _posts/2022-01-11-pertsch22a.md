abstract: 'Demonstration-guided reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach
  for learning complex behaviors by leveraging both reward feedback and a set of target
  task demonstrations. Prior approaches for demonstration-guided RL treat every new
  task as an independent learning problem and attempt to follow the provided demonstrations
  step-by-step, akin to a human trying to imitate a completely unseen behavior by
  following the demonstratorâ€™s exact muscle movements. Naturally, such learning will
  be slow, but often new behaviors are not completely unseen: they share subtasks
  with behaviors we have previously learned. In this work, we aim to exploit this
  shared subtask structure to increase the efficiency of demonstration-guided RL.
  We first learn a set of reusable skills from large offline datasets of prior experience
  collected across many tasks. We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations
  (SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages the
  provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the primitive
  actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior demonstration-guided
  RL approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on long-horizon maze
  navigation and complex robot manipulation tasks.'
