title: Generating Scenarios with Diverse Pedestrian Behaviors for Autonomous Vehicle
  Testing
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: HTfApPeT4DZ
abstract: There exist several datasets for developing self-driving car methodologies.
  Manually collected datasets impose inherent limitations on the variability of test
  cases and it is particularly difficult to acquire challenging scenarios, e.g. ones
  involving collisions with pedestrians. A way to alleviate this is to consider automatic
  generation of safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing. Existing
  approaches for scenario generation use heuristic pedestrian behavior models. We
  instead propose a framework that can use state-of-the-art pedestrian motion models,
  which is achieved by reformulating the problem as learning where to place pedestrians
  such that the induced scenarios are collision prone for a given AV. Our pedestrian
  initial location model can be used in conjunction with any goal driven pedestrian
  model which makes it possible to challenge an AV with a wide range of pedestrian
  behaviors â€“ this ensures that the AV can avoid collisions with any pedestrian it
  encounters. We show that it is possible to learn a collision seeking scenario generation
  model when both the pedestrian and AV are collision avoiding. The initial location
  model is conditioned on scene semantics and occlusions to ensure semantic and visual
  plausibility, which increases the realism of generated scenarios. Our model can
  be used to test any AV model given sufficient constraints.
