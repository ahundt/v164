title: Smooth Exploration for Robotic Reinforcement Learning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: TSuSGVkjuXd
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) enables robots to learn skills from interactions
  with the real world. In practice, the unstructured step-based exploration used in
  Deep RL – often very successful in simulation – leads to jerky motion patterns on
  real robots. Consequences of the resulting shaky behavior are poor exploration,
  or even damage to the robot. We address these issues by adapting state-dependent
  exploration (SDE) to current Deep RL algorithms. To enable this adaptation, we propose
  two extensions to the original SDE, using more general features and re-sampling
  the noise periodically, which leads to a new exploration method generalized state-dependent
  exploration (gSDE). We evaluate gSDE both in simulation, on PyBullet continuous
  control tasks, and directly on three different real robots: a tendon-driven elastic
  robot, a quadruped and an RC car. The noise sampling interval of gSDE enables a
  compromise between performance and smoothness, which allows training directly on
  the real robots without loss of performance.'
