title: Haptics-based Curiosity for Sparse-reward Tasks

abstract: Robots in many real-world settings have access to force/torque sensors in
  their gripper and tactile sensing is often necessary for tasks that involve contact-rich
  motion. In this work, we leverage surprise from mismatches in haptics feedback to
  guide exploration in hard sparse-reward reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach,
  Haptics-based Curiosity (HaC), learns what visible objects interactions are supposed
  to â€œfeel" like. We encourage exploration by rewarding interactions where the expectation
  and the experience do not match. We test our approach on a range of haptics-intensive
  robot arm tasks (e.g. pushing objects, opening doors), which we also release as
  part of this work. Across multiple experiments in a simulated setting, we demonstrate
  that our method is able to learn these difficult tasks through sparse reward and
  curiosity alone. We compare our cross-modal approach to single-modality (haptics-
  or vision-only) approaches as well as other curiosity-based methods and find that
  our method performs better and is more sample-efficient.
