abstract: 'If a robot’s dynamics are difficult to model solely through analytical
  mechanics, it is an attractive option to directly learn it from data. Yet, solely
  data-driven approaches require considerable amounts of data for training and do
  not extrapolate well to unseen regions of the system’s state space. In this work,
  we emphasize that when a robot’s links are sufficiently rigid, many analytical functions
  such as kinematics, inertia functions, and surface constraints encode informative
  prior knowledge on its dynamics. To this effect, we propose a framework for learning
  probabilistic forward dynamics that combines physics knowledge with Gaussian processes
  utilizing automatic differentiation with GPU acceleration. Compared to solely data-driven
  modeling, the model’s data efficiency improves while the model also respects physical
  constraints. We illustrate the proposed structured model on a seven joint robot
  arm in PyBullet. Our implementation of the proposed framework can be found here:
