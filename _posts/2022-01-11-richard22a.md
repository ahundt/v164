title: Learning Behaviors through Physics-driven Latent Imagination
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: YwDvofEWlEx
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) consists in learning a so-called
  world model, a representation of the environment through interactions with it, then
  use it to train an agent. This approach is particularly interesting in the con-text
  of field robotics, as it alleviates the need to train online, and reduces the risks
  inherent to directly training agents on real robots. Generally, in such approaches,
  the world encompasses both the part related to the robot itself and the rest of
  the environment. We argue that decoupling the environment representation (for example,
  images or laser scans) from the dynamics of the physical system (that is, the robot
  and its physical state) can increase the flexibility of world models and open doors
  to greater robustness. In this paper, we apply this concept to a strong latent-agent,
  Dreamer. We then showcase the increased flexibility by transferring the environment
  part of the world model from one robot (a boat) to another (a rover), simply by
  adapting the physical model in the imagination. We additionally demonstrate the
  robustness of our method through real-world experiments on a boat.
