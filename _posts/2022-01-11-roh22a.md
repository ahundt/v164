abstract: 'For robots to understand human instructions and perform meaningful tasks
  in the near future, it is important to develop learned models that comprehend referential
  language to identify common objects in real-world 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce
  a spatial-language model for a 3D visual grounding problem. Specifically, given
  a reconstructed 3D scene in the form of point clouds with 3D bounding boxes of potential
  object candidates, and a language utterance referring to a target object in the
  scene, our model successfully identifies the target object from a set of potential
  candidates. Specifically, LanguageRefer uses a transformer-based architecture that
  combines spatial embedding from bounding boxes with fine-tuned language embeddings
  from DistilBert to predict the target object. We show that it performs competitively
  on visio-linguistic datasets proposed by ReferIt3D. Further, we analyze its spatial
  reasoning task performance decoupled from perception noise, the accuracy of view-dependent
  utterances, and viewpoint annotations for potential robotics applications. Project
