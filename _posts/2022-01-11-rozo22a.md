title: Orientation Probabilistic Movement Primitives on Riemannian Manifolds
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: csMg2h_LR37
abstract: 'Learning complex robot motions necessarily demands to have models that
  are able to encode and retrieve full-pose trajectories when tasks are defined in
  operational spaces. Probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) stand out as a principled
  approach that models trajectory distributions learned from demonstrations. ProMPs
  allow for trajectory modulation and blending to achieve better generalization to
  novel situations. However, when ProMPs are employed in operational space, their
  original formulation does not directly apply to full-pose movements including rotational
  trajectories described by quaternions. This paper proposes a Riemannian formulation
  of ProMPs that enables encoding and retrieving of quaternion trajectories. Our method
  builds on Riemannian manifold theory, and exploits multilinear geodesic regression
  for estimating the ProMPs parameters. This novel approach makes ProMPs a suitable
  model for learning complex full-pose robot motion patterns. Riemannian ProMPs are
  tested on toy examples to illustrate their workflow, and on real learning-from-demonstration
  experiments. '
