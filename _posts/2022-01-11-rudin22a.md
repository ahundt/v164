abstract: 'In this work, we present and study a training set-up that achieves fast
  policy generation for real-world robotic tasks by using massive parallelism on a
  single workstation GPU. We analyze and discuss the impact of different training
  algorithm components in the massively parallel regime on the final policy performance
  and training times. In addition, we present a novel game-inspired curriculum that
  is well suited for training with thousands of simulated robots in parallel. We evaluate
  the approach by training the quadrupedal robot ANYmal to walk on challenging terrain.
  The parallel approach allows training policies for flat terrain in under four minutes,
  and in twenty minutes for uneven terrain. This represents a speedup of multiple
  orders of magnitude compared to previous work. Finally, we transfer the policies
  to the real robot to validate the approach. We open-source our training code to
  help accelerate further research in the field of learned legged locomotion: https://leggedrobotics.github.io/legged_gym/.'
