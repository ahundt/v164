title: 'CLASP: Constrained Latent Shape Projection for Refining Object Shape from
  Robot Contact'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: jV0n2wJocXr

abstract: 'Robots need both visual and contact sensing to effectively estimate the
  state of their environment. Camera RGBD data provides rich information of the objects
  surrounding the robot, and shape priors can help correct noise and fill in gaps
  and occluded regions. However, when the robot senses unexpected contact, the estimate
  should be updated to explain the contact. To address this need, we propose CLASP:
  Constrained Latent Shape Projection. This approach consists of a shape completion
  network that generates a prior from RGBD data and a procedure to generate shapes
  consistent with both the network prior and robot contact observations. We find CLASP
  consistently decreases the Chamfer Distance between the predicted and ground truth
  scenes, while other approaches do not benefit from contact information.'
