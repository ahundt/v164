abstract: In this work we are the first to present an offline policy gradient method
  for learning imitative policies for complex urban driving from a large corpus of
  real-world demonstrations. This is achieved by building a differentiable data-driven
  simulator on top of perception outputs and high-fidelity HD maps of the area. It
  allows us to synthesize new driving experiences from existing demonstrations using
  mid-level representations. Using this simulator we then train a policy network in
  closed-loop employing policy gradients. We train our proposed method on 100 hours
  of expert demonstrations on urban roads and show that it learns complex driving
  policies that generalize well and can perform a variety of driving maneuvers. We
  demonstrate this in simulation as well as deploy our model to self-driving vehicles
  in the real-world. Our method outperforms previously demonstrated state-of-the-art
  for urban driving scenarios - all this without the need for complex state perturbations
  or collecting additional on-policy data during training. We make code and data publicly
  available.
