title: 'Just Label What You Need: Fine-Grained Active Selection for P&P through Partially
  Labeled Scenes'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: xQ8rr3-zpiH
abstract: 'Self-driving vehicles must perceive and predict the future positions of
  nearby actors to avoid collisions and drive safely. A deep learning module is often
  responsible for this task, requiring large-scale, high-quality training datasets.
  Due to high labeling costs, active learning approaches are an appealing solution
  to maximizing model performance for a given labeling budget. However, despite its
  appeal, there has been little scientific analysis of active learning approaches
  for the perception and prediction (P&P) problem. In this work, we study active learning
  techniques for P&P and find that the traditional active learning formulation is
  ill-suited. We thus introduce generalizations that ensure that our approach is both
  cost-aware and allows for fine-grained selection of examples through partially labeled
  scenes. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset suggest significant improvements
  across perception, prediction, and downstream planning tasks. '
