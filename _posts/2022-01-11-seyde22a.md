abstract: Efficiency in robot learning is highly dependent on hyperparameters. Robot
  morphology and task structure differ widely and finding the optimal setting typically
  requires sequential or parallel repetition of experiments, strongly increasing the
  interaction count. We propose a training method that only relies on a single trial
  by enabling agents to select and combine controller designs conditioned on the task.
  Our Hyperparameter Mixture Policies (HMPs) feature diverse sub-policies that vary
  in distribution types and parameterization, reducing the impact of design choices
  and unlocking synergies between low-level components. We demonstrate strong performance
  on continuous control tasks, including a simulated ANYmal robot, showing that HMPs
  yield robust, data-efficient learning.
