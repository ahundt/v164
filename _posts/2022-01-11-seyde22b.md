title: 'Learning to Plan Optimistically: Uncertainty-Guided Deep Exploration via Latent
  Model Ensembles'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: pXpytHo_GC1
abstract: Learning complex robot behaviors through interaction requires structured
  exploration. Planning should target interactions with the potential to optimize
  long-term performance, while only reducing uncertainty where conducive to this objective.  This
  paper presents Latent Optimistic Value Exploration (LOVE), a strategy that enables
  deep exploration through optimism in the face of uncertain long-term rewards.  We
  combine latent world models with value function estimation to predict infinite-horizon
  returns and recover associated uncertainty via ensembling. The policy is then trained
  on an upper confidence bound (UCB) objective to identify and select the interactions
  most promising to improve long-term performance. We apply LOVE to visual robot control
  tasks in continuous action spaces and demonstrate on average more than 20% improved
  sample efficiency in comparison to state-of-the-art and other exploration objectives.
  In sparse and hard to explore environments we achieve an average improvement of
  over 30%.
