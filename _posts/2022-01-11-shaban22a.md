abstract: Producing dense and accurate traversability maps is crucial for autonomous
  off-road navigation. In this paper, we focus on the problem of classifying terrains
  into 4 cost classes (free, low-cost, medium-cost, obstacle) for traversability assessment.
  This requires a robot to reason about both semantics (what objects are present?)
  and geometric properties (where are the objects located?) of the environment. To
  achieve this goal, we develop a novel Birdâ€™s Eye View Network (BEVNet), a deep neural
  network that directly predicts a local map encoding terrain classes from sparse
  LiDAR inputs. BEVNet processes both geometric and semantic information in a temporally
  consistent fashion. More importantly, it uses learned prior and history to predict
  terrain classes in unseen space and into the future, allowing a robot to better
  appraise its situation. We quantitatively evaluate BEVNet on both on-road and off-road
  scenarios and show that it outperforms a variety of strong baselines.
