abstract: We describe a robotic learning system for autonomous exploration and navigation
  in diverse, open-world environments. At the core of our method is a learned latent
  variable model of distances and actions, along with a non-parametric topological
  memory of images. We use an information bottleneck to regularize the learned policy,
  giving us (i) a compact visual representation of goals, (ii) improved generalization
  capabilities, and (iii) a mechanism for sampling feasible goals for exploration.
  Trained on a large offline dataset of prior experience, the model acquires a representation
  of visual goals that is robust to task-irrelevant distractors. We demonstrate our
  method on a mobile ground robot in open-world exploration scenarios. Given an image
  of a goal that is up to 80 meters away, our method leverages its representation
  to explore and discover the goal in under 20 minutes, even amidst previously-unseen
  obstacles and weather conditions.
