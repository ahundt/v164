section: Contributed Papers
openreview: a7DcA81EV4t
abstract: " Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have successfully been demonstrated
  on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. One dominant component
  of recent deep reinforcement learning algorithms is the target network which mitigates
  the divergence when learning the Q function. However, target networks can slow down
  the learning process due to delayed function updates. Our main contribution in this
  work is a self-regularized TD-learning method to address divergence without requiring
  a target network. Additionally, we propose a self-guided policy improvement method
  by combining policy-gradient with zero-order optimization to search for actions
  associated with higher Q-values in a broad neighborhood. This makes learning more
  robust to local noise in the Q function approximation and guides the updates of
  our actor network. Taken together, these components define GRAC, a novel self-guided
  and self-regularized actor-critic algorithm. We evaluate GRAC on the OpenAI gym
  tasks, outperforming state of the art on four tasks and achieving competitive results
  on two environments. We also apply  GRAC to enable a non-anthropomorphic robotic
  hand to successfully accomplish an in-hand manipulation task in the real world."
