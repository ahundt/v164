abstract: 'How can we imbue robots with the ability to manipulate objects precisely
  but also to reason about them in terms of abstract concepts? Recent works in manipulation
  have shown that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills that require precise
  spatial reasoning, but these methods often fail to generalize to new goals or quickly
  learn transferable concepts across tasks. In parallel, there has been great progress
  in learning generalizable semantic representations for vision and language by training
  on large-scale internet data, however these representations lack the spatial understanding
  necessary for fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that
  combines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and spatial
  pathways for vision-based manipulation. Specifically, we present CLIPort, a language-conditioned
  imitation-learning agent that combines the broad semantic understanding (what) of
  CLIP [1] with the spatial precision (where) of Transporter [2]. Our end-to-end framework
  is capable of solving a variety of language-specified tabletop tasks from packing
  unseen objects to folding cloths, all without any explicit representations of object
  poses, instance segmentations, memory, symbolic states, or syntactic structures.
  Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our approach is data
  efficient in few-shot settings and generalizes effectively to seen and unseen semantic
  concepts. We even learn one multi-task policy for 10 simulated and 9 real-world
  tasks that is better or comparable to single-task policies.'
