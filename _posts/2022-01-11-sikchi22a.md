abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in low-data and risk-sensitive domains requires
  performant and flexible deployment policies that can readily incorporate constraints
  during deployment. One such class of policies are the semi-parametric H-step lookahead
  policies, which select actions using trajectory optimization over a dynamics model
  for a fixed horizon with a terminal value function. In this work, we investigate
  a novel instantiation of H-step lookahead with a learned model and a terminal value
  function learned by a model-free off-policy algorithm, named Learning Off-Policy
  with Online Planning (LOOP). We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, suggesting
  a tradeoff between model errors and value function errors, and empirically demonstrate
  this tradeoff to be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we identify
  the "Actor Divergence" issue in this framework and propose Actor Regularized Control
  (ARC), a modified trajectory optimization procedure. We evaluate our method on a
  set of robotic tasks for Offline and Online RL and demonstrate improved performance.
  We also show the flexibility of LOOP to incorporate safety constraints during deployment
  with a set of navigation environments. We demonstrate that LOOP is a desirable framework
  for robotics applications based on its strong performance in various important RL
  settings. Project video and details can be found at hari-sikchi.github.io/loop.
