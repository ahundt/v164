title: 'S4RL: Surprisingly Simple Self-Supervision for Offline Reinforcement Learning
  in Robotics'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: 8xC5NNej-l_
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning proposes to learn policies from large collected
  datasets without interacting with the physical environment.  These algorithms have
  made it possible to learn useful skills from data that can then be deployed in the
  environment in real-world settings where interactions may be costly or dangerous,
  such as autonomous driving or factories.  However, offline agents are unable to
  access the environment to collect new data, and therefore are trained on a static
  dataset.  In this paper, we study the effectiveness of performing data augmentations
  on the state space, and study 7 different augmentation schemes and how they behave
  with existing offline RL algorithms. We then combine the best data performing augmentation
  scheme with a state-of-the-art Q-learning technique, and improve the function approximation
  of the Q-networks by smoothening out the learned state-action space. We experimentally
  show that using this Surprisingly Simple Self-Supervision technique in RL (S4RL),
  we significantly improve over the current state-of-the-art algorithms on offline
  robot learning environments such as MetaWorld [1] and RoboSuite [2,3], and benchmark
  datasets such as D4RL [4].
