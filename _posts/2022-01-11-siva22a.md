title: Enhancing Consistent Ground Maneuverability by Robot Adaptation to Complex
  Off-Road Terrains
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: WIE9t_UwOpM
abstract: Terrain adaptation is a critical ability for a ground robot to effectively
  traverse unstructured off-road terrain in real-world field environments such as
  forests. However, the expected or planned maneuvering behaviors cannot always be
  accurately executed due to setbacks such as reduced tire pressure. This inconsistency
  negatively affects the robot’s ground maneuverability and can cause slower traversal
  time or errors in localization.  To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel
  method for consistent behavior generation that enables a ground robot’s actual behaviors
  to more accurately match expected behaviors while adapting to a variety of complex
  off-road terrains. Our method learns offset behaviors in a self-supervised fashion
  to compensate for the inconsistency between the actual and expected behaviors without
  requiring the explicit modeling of various setbacks. To evaluate the method, we
  perform extensive experiments using a physical ground robot over diverse complex
  off-road terrain in real-world field environments.  Experimental results show that
  our method enables a robot to improve its ground maneuverability on complex unstructured
  off-road terrain with more navigational behavior consistency, and outperforms previous
  and baseline methods, particularly so on challenging terrain such as that which
  is seen in forests.
