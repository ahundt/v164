title: Learning to Predict Vehicle Trajectories with Model-based Planning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: GhMZNcr54zt
abstract: Predicting the future trajectories of on-road vehicles is critical for autonomous
  driving. In this paper, we introduce a novel prediction framework called PRIME,
  which stands for Prediction with Model-based Planning. Unlike recent prediction
  works that utilize neural networks to model scene context and produce unconstrained
  trajectories, PRIME is designed to generate accurate and feasibility-guaranteed
  future trajectory predictions. PRIME guarantees the trajectory feasibility by exploiting
  a model-based generator to produce future trajectories under explicit constraints
  and enables accurate multimodal prediction by utilizing a learning-based evaluator
  to select future trajectories. We conduct experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
  Motion Forecasting Benchmark, where PRIME outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
  in prediction accuracy, feasibility, and robustness under imperfect tracking.
