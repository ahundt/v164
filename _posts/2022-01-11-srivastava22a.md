abstract: 'We introduce BEHAVIOR, a benchmark for embodied AI with 100 activities
  in simulation, spanning a range of everyday household chores such as cleaning, maintenance,
  and food preparation. These activities are designed to be realistic, diverse and
  complex, aiming to reproduce the challenges that agents must face in the real world.
  Building such a benchmark poses three fundamental difficulties for each activity:
  definition (it can differ by time, place, or person), instantiation in a simulator,
  and evaluation. BEHAVIOR addresses these with three innovations. First, we propose
  a predicate logic-based description language for expressing an activity’s initial
  and goal conditions, enabling generation of diverse instances for any activity.
  Second, we identify the simulator-agnostic features required by an underlying environment
  to support BEHAVIOR, and demonstrate in one such simulator. Third, we introduce
  a set of metrics to measure task progress and efficiency, absolute and relative
  to human demonstrators. We include 500 human demonstrations in virtual reality (VR)
  to serve as the human ground truth. Our experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art
  embodied AI solutions struggle with the level of realism, diversity, and complexity
  imposed by the activities in our benchmark. We make BEHAVIOR publicly available
  at behavior.stanford.edu to facilitate and calibrate the development of new embodied
  AI solutions.'
