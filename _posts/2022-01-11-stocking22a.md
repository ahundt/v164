title: 'From Robot Learning To Robot Understanding: Leveraging Causal Graphical Models
  For Robotics'
section: Blue Sky Papers
openreview: DMevLBCwnRS
abstract: Causal graphical models have been proposed as a way to efficiently and explicitly
  reason about novel situations and the likely outcomes of decisions. A key challenge
  facing widespread implementation of these models in robots is using prior knowledge
  to hypothesize good candidate causal structures when the relevant environmental
  features are not known in advance. The tight link between causal reasoning and the
  ability to intervene in the world suggests that robotics has much to contribute
  to this challenge and would reap significant benefits from progress.
