abstract: We study how robots can autonomously learn skills that require a combination
  of navigation and grasping. Learning robotic skills in the real world remains challenging
  without large scale data collection and supervision. Our aim is to devise a robotic
  reinforcement learning system for learning navigation and manipulation together,
  in an autonomous way without human intervention, enabling continual learning under
  realistic assumptions. Specifically, our system, ReLMM, can learn continuously on
  a real-world platform without any environment instrumentation, without human intervention,
  and without access to privileged information, such as maps, objects positions, or
  a global view of the environment. Our method employs a modularized policy with components
  for manipulation and navigation, where uncertainty over the manipulation success
  drives exploration for the navigation controller, and the manipulation module provides
  rewards for navigation. We evaluate our method on a room cleanup task, where the
  robot must navigate to and pick up items of scattered on the floor. After a grasp
  curriculum training phase, ReLMM can learn navigation and grasping together fully
  automatically, in around 40 hours of real-world training.
