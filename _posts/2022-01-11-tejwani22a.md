title: Social Interactions as Recursive MDPs

abstract: While machines and robots must interact with humans, providing them with
  social skills has been a largely overlooked topic. This is mostly a consequence
  of the fact that tasks such as navigation, command following, and even game playing
  are well-defined, while social reasoning still mostly remains a pre-theoretic problem.
  We demonstrate how social interactions can be effectively incorporated into MDPs
  by reasoning recursively about the goals of other agents. In essence, our method
  extends the reward function to include a combination of physical goals (something
  agents want to accomplish in the configuration space, a traditional MDP) and social
  goals (something agents want to accomplish relative to the goals of other agents).
  Our Social MDPs allow specifying reward functions in terms of the estimated reward
  functions of other agents, modeling interactions such as helping or hindering another
  agent (by maximizing or minimizing the other agent’s reward) while balancing this
  with the actual physical goals of each agent. Our formulation allows for an arbitrary
  function of another agent’s estimated reward structure and physical goals, enabling
  more complex behaviors such as politely hindering another agent or aggressively
  helping them. Extending Social MDPs in the same manner as I-POMDPs extension would
  enable interactions such as convincing another agent that something is true. To
  what extent the Social MDPs presented here and their potential Social POMDPs variant
  account for all possible social interactions is unknown, but having a precise mathematical
  model to guide questions about social interactions has both practical value (we
  demonstrate how to make zero-shot social inferences and one could imagine chatbots
  and robots guided by Social MDPs) and theoretical value by bringing the tools of
  MDP that have so successfully organized research around navigation to hopefully
  shed light on what social interactions really are given their extreme importance
  to human well-being and human civilization.
