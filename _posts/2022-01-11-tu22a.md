title: Exploring Adversarial Robustness of Multi-sensor Perception Systems in Self
  Driving
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: m5k1XdK5nI2
abstract: Modern self-driving perception systems have been shown to improve upon processing
  complementary inputs such as LiDAR with images. In isolation, 2D images have been
  found to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Yet, there are limited
  studies on the adversarial robustness of multi-modal models that fuse LiDAR and
  image features. Furthermore, existing works do not consider physically realizable
  perturbations that are consistent across the input modalities. In this paper, we
  showcase practical susceptibilities of multi-sensor detection by inserting an adversarial
  object on a host vehicle. We focus on physically realizable and input-agnostic attacks
  that are feasible to execute in practice, and show that a single universal adversary
  can hide different host vehicles from state-of-the-art multi-modal detectors. Our
  experiments demonstrate that successful attacks are primarily caused by easily corrupted
  image features. Furthermore, in modern sensor fusion methods which project image
  features into 3D, adversarial attacks can  exploit  the projection process to generate
  false positives in distant regions in 3D. Towards more robust multi-modal perception
  systems, we show that adversarial training with feature denoising can boost robustness
  to such attacks significantly.
