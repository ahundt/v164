abstract: We introduce a simple but effective method for managing risk in zero-order
  trajectory optimization that involves probabilistic safety constraints and balancing
  of optimism in the face of epistemic uncertainty and pessimism in the face of aleatoric
  uncertainty of an ensemble of stochastic neural networks. Various experiments indicate
  that the separation of uncertainties is essential to performing well with data-driven
  MPC approaches in uncertain and safety-critical control environments.
