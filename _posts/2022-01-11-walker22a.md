title: Influencing Behavioral Attributions to Robot Motion During Task Execution
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: UIaodSPHNFN
abstract: While prior work has shown how to autonomously generate motion that communicates
  task-related attributes, like intent or capability, we know less about how to automatically
  generate motion that communicates higher-level behavioral attributes such as curiosity
  or competence. We propose a framework that addresses the challenges of modeling
  human attributions to robot motion, generating trajectories that elicit attributions,
  and selecting trajectories that balance attribution and task completion. The insight
  underpinning our approach is that attributions can be ascribed to features of the
  motion that donâ€™t severely impact task performance, and that these features form
  a convenient basis both for predicting and generating communicative motion. We illustrate
  the framework in a coverage task resembling household vacuum cleaning. Through a
  virtual interface, we collect a dataset of human attributions to robot trajectories
  during task execution and learn a probabilistic model that maps trajectories to
  attributions. We then incorporate this model into a trajectory generation mechanism
  that balances between task completion and communication of a desired behavioral
  attribute. Through an online user study on a different household layout, we find
  that our prediction model accurately captures human attribution for coverage tasks.
