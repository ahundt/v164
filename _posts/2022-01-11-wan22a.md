title: Visual Learning Towards Soft Robot Force Control using a 3D Metamaterial with
  Differential Stiffness
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: kR8UWCty--O
abstract: This paper explores the feasibility of learning robot force control and
  interaction using soft metamaterial and machine vision. We start by investigating
  the differential stiffness of a hollow, cone-shaped, 3D metamaterial made from soft
  rubber, achieving a large stiffness ratio between the axial and radial directions
  that leads to an adaptive form response in omni-directions during physical interaction.
  Then, using image data collected from its internal deformation during various interactions,
  we explored two similar designs but different learning strategies to estimate force
  control and interactions on the end-effector of a UR10 e-series robot arm. One is
  to directly learn the force and torque response from raw images of the metamaterialâ€™s
  internal deformation. The other is to indirectly estimate the 6D force and torque
  using a neural network by visually tracking the 6D pose of a marker fixed inside
  the 3D metamaterial. Finally, we integrated the two proposed systems and achieved
  similar force feedback and control interactions in simple tasks such as circle following
  and text writing. Our results show that the learning method holds the potential
  to support the concept of soft robot force control, providing an intuitive interface
  at a low cost for robotic systems, generating comparable and capable performances
  against classical force and torque sensors.
