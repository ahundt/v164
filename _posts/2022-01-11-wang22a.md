abstract: 6D robotic grasping beyond top-down bin-picking scenarios is a challenging
  task. Previous solutions based on 6D grasp synthesis with robot motion planning
  usually operate in an open-loop setting, which are sensitive to grasp synthesis
  errors. In this work, we propose a new method for learning closed-loop control policies
  for 6D grasping. Our policy takes a segmented point cloud of an object from an egocentric
  camera as input, and outputs continuous 6D control actions of the robot gripper
  for grasping the object. We combine imitation learning and reinforcement learning
  and introduce a goal-auxiliary actor-critic algorithm for policy learning. We demonstrate
  that our learned policy can be integrated into a tabletop 6D grasping system and
  a human-robot handover system to improve the grasping performance of unseen objects.
