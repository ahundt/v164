abstract: We introduce a framework for multi-camera 3D object detection. In contrast
  to existing works, which estimate 3D bounding boxes directly from monocular images
  or use depth prediction networks to generate input for 3D object detection from
  2D information, our method manipulates predictions directly in 3D space. Our architecture
  extracts 2D  features from multiple camera images and then uses a sparse set of
  3D object queries to index into these 2D features, linking 3D positions to multi-view
  images using camera transformation matrices. Finally, our model makes a bounding
  box prediction per object query, using a set-to-set loss to measure the discrepancy
  between the ground-truth and the prediction. This top-down approach outperforms
  its bottom-up counterpart in which object bounding box prediction follows per-pixel
  depth estimation, since it does not suffer from the compounding error introduced
  by a depth prediction model. Moreover, our method does not require  post-processing
  such as non-maximum suppression, dramatically improving inference speed. We achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes autonomous driving benchmark.
