title: Rough Terrain Navigation Using Divergence Constrained Model-Based Reinforcement
  Learning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: Wt3GLZYFvEQ
abstract: Autonomous navigation of wheeled robots in rough terrain environments has
  been a long standing challenge. In these environments, predicting the robot’s trajectory
  can be challenging due to the complexity of terrain interactions, as well as the
  divergent dynamics that cause model uncertainty to compound and propagate poorly.
  This inhibits the robot’s long horizon decision making capabilities and often lead
  to shortsighted navigation strategies. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning
  algorithm for rough terrain traversal that trains a probabilistic dynamics model
  to consider the propagating effects of uncertainty. During trajectory predictions,
  a trajectory tracking controller is considered to predict closed-loop trajectories.
  Our method further increases prediction accuracy and precision by using constrained
  optimization to find trajectories with low divergence. Using this method, wheeled
  robots can find non-myopic control strategies to reach destinations with higher
  probability of success. We show results on simulated and real world robots navigating
  through rough terrain environments.
