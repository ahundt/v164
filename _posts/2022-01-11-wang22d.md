title: Adversarially Robust Imitation Learning
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: 9aVCUv3nKBg
abstract: Modern imitation learning (IL) utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) as function
  approximators to mimic the policy of the expert demonstrations. However, DNNs can
  be easily fooled by subtle noise added to the input, which is even non-detectable
  by humans. This makes the learned agent vulnerable to attacks, especially in IL
  where agents can struggle to recover from the errors. In such light, we propose
  a sound Adversarially Robust Imitation Learning (ARIL) method. In our setting, an
  agent and an adversary are trained alternatively. The former with adversarially
  attacked input at each timestep mimics the behavior of an online expert and the
  latter learns to add perturbations on the states by forcing the learned agent to
  fail on choosing the right decisions. We theoretically prove that ARIL can achieve
  adversarial robustness and evaluate ARIL on multiple benchmarks from DM Control
  Suite. The result reveals that our method (ARIL) achieves better robustness compare
  with other imitation learning methods under both sensory attack and physical attack.
