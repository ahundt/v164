title: Group-based Motion Prediction for Navigation in Crowded Environments
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: knObbYqSowX
abstract: We focus on the problem of planning the motion of a robot in a dynamic multiagent
  environment such as a pedestrian scene. Enabling the robot to navigate safely and
  in a socially compliant fashion in such scenes requires a representation that accounts
  for the unfolding multiagent dynamics. Existing approaches to this problem tend
  to employ microscopic models of motion prediction that reason about the individual
  behavior of other agents. While such models may achieve high tracking accuracy in
  trajectory prediction benchmarks, they often lack an understanding of the group
  structures unfolding in crowded scenes. Inspired by the Gestalt theory from psychology,
  we build a Model Predictive Control framework (G-MPC) that leverages group-based
  prediction for robot motion planning. We conduct an extensive simulation study involving
  a series of challenging navigation tasks in scenes extracted from two real-world
  pedestrian datasets. We illustrate that G-MPC enables a robot to achieve statistically
  significantly higher safety and lower number of group intrusions than a series of
  baselines featuring individual pedestrian motion prediction models. Finally, we
  show that G-MPC can handle noisy lidar-scan estimates without significant performance
  losses.
