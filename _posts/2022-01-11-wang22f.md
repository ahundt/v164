abstract: Learning in multi-agent environments is difficult due to the non-stationarity
  introduced by an opponent’s or partner’s changing behaviors. Instead of reactively
  adapting to the other agent’s (opponent or partner) behavior, we propose an algorithm
  to proactively influence the other agent’s strategy to stabilize – which can restrain
  the non-stationarity caused by the other agent. We learn a low-dimensional latent
  representation of the other agent’s strategy and the dynamics of how the latent
  strategy evolves with respect to our robot’s behavior. With this learned dynamics
  model, we can define an unsupervised stability reward to train our robot to deliberately
  influence the other agent to stabilize towards a single strategy. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of stabilizing in improving efficiency of maximizing the task
  reward in a variety of simulated environments, including autonomous driving, emergent
  communication, and robotic manipulation. We show qualitative results on our website.
