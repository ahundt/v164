abstract: A promising approach to solving challenging long-horizon tasks has been
  to extract behavior priors (skills) by fitting generative models to large offline
  datasets of demonstrations. However, such generative models inherit the biases of
  the underlying data and result in poor and unusable skills when trained on imperfect
  demonstration data. To better align skill extraction with human intent we present
  Skill Preferences (SkiP), an algorithm that learns a model over human preferences
  and uses it to extract human-aligned skills from offline data. After extracting
  human-preferred skills, SkiP also utilizes human feedback to solve downstream tasks
  with RL. We show that SkiP enables a simulated kitchen robot to solve complex multi-step
  manipulation tasks and substantially outperforms prior leading RL algorithms with
  human preferences as well as leading skill extraction algorithms without human preferences.
