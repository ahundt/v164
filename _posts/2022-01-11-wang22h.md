abstract: 'We present a method for learning human-robot collaboration policy from
  human-human collaboration demonstrations. An effective robot assistant must learn
  to handle diverse human behaviors shown in the demonstrations and be robust when
  the humans adjust their strategies during online task execution. Our method co-optimizes
  a human policy and a robot policy in an interactive learning process: the human
  policy learns to generate diverse and plausible collaborative behaviors from demonstrations
  while the robot policy learns to assist by estimating the unobserved latent strategy
  of its human collaborator. Across a 2D strategy game, a human-robot handover task,
  and a multi-step collaborative manipulation task, our method outperforms the alternatives
  in both simulated evaluations and when executing the tasks with a real human operator
  in-the-loop. Supplementary materials and videos at https://sites.google.com/view/cogail/home'
