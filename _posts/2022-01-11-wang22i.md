abstract: '3D object detection is an important capability needed in various practical
  applications such as driver assistance systems. Monocular 3D detection, a representative
  general setting among image-based approaches, provides a more economical solution
  than conventional settings relying on LiDARs but still yields unsatisfactory results.
  This paper first presents a systematic study on this problem. We observe that the
  current monocular 3D detection can be simplified as an instance depth estimation
  problem: The inaccurate instance depth blocks all the other 3D attribute predictions
  from improving the overall detection performance. Moreover, recent methods directly
  estimate the depth based on isolated instances or pixels while ignoring the geometric
  relations across different objects. To this end, we construct geometric relation
  graphs across predicted objects and use the graph to facilitate depth estimation.
  As the preliminary depth estimation of each instance is usually inaccurate in this
  ill-posed setting, we incorporate a probabilistic representation to capture the
  uncertainty. It provides an important indicator to identify confident predictions
  and further guide the depth propagation. Despite the simplicity of the basic idea,
  our method, PGD, obtains significant improvements on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks,
  achieving 1st place out of all monocular vision-only methods while still maintaining
  real-time efficiency. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.'
