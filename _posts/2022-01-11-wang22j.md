title: Equivariant $Q$ Learning in Spatial Action Spaces

abstract: 'Recently, a variety of new equivariant neural network model architectures
  have been proposed that generalize better over rotational and reflectional symmetries
  than standard models. These models are relevant to robotics because many robotics
  problems can be expressed in a rotationally symmetric way. This paper focuses on
  equivariance over a visual state space and a spatial action space â€“ the setting
  where the robot action space includes a subset of $\rm{SE}(2)$. In this situation,
  we know a priori that rotations and translations in the state image should result
  in the same rotations and translations in the spatial action dimensions of the optimal
  policy. Therefore, we can use equivariant model architectures to make $Q$ learning
  more sample efficient. This paper identifies when the optimal $Q$ function is equivariant
  and proposes $Q$ network architectures for this setting. We show experimentally
  that this approach outperforms standard methods in a set of challenging manipulation
  problems. '
