abstract: 'We address the problem of goal-directed cloth manipulation, a challenging
  task due to the deformability of cloth. Our insight is that optical flow, a technique
  normally used for motion estimation in video, can also provide an effective representation
  for corresponding cloth poses across observation and goal images. We introduce FabricFlowNet
  (FFN), a cloth manipulation policy that leverages flow as both an input and as an
  action representation to improve performance. FabricFlowNet also elegantly switches
  between bimanual and single-arm actions based on the desired goal. We show that
  FabricFlowNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based
  cloth manipulation policies that take image input. We also present real-world experiments
  on a bimanual system, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer.  Finally, we
  show that our method generalizes when trained on a single square cloth to other
  cloth shapes, such as T-shirts and rectangular cloths. Video and other supplementary
  materials are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/fabricflownet.'
