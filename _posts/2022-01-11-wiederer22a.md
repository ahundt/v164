abstract: Human drivers can recognise fast abnormal driving situations to avoid accidents.
  Similar to humans, automated vehicles are supposed to perform anomaly detection.
  In this work, we propose the spatio-temporal graph auto-encoder for learning normal
  driving behaviours. Our innovation is the ability to jointly learn multiple trajectories
  of a dynamic number of agents. To perform anomaly detection, we first estimate a
  density function of the learned trajectory feature representation and then detect
  anomalies in low-density regions. Due to the lack of multi-agent trajectory datasets
  for anomaly detection in automated driving, we introduce our dataset using a driving
  simulator for normal and abnormal manoeuvres. Our evaluations show that our approach
  learns the relation between different agents and delivers promising results compared
  to the related works. The code, simulation and the dataset are publicly available.
