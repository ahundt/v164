abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive success in exploring high-dimensional
  environments to learn complex tasks, but can often exhibit unsafe behaviors and
  require extensive environment interaction when exploration is unconstrained. A promising
  strategy for learning in dynamically uncertain environments is requiring that the
  agent can robustly return to learned Safe Sets, where task success (and therefore
  safety) can be guaranteed. While this approach has been successful in low-dimensions,
  enforcing this constraint in environments with visual observation spaces is exceedingly
  challenging. We present a novel continuous representation for Safe Sets framed as
  a binary classification problem in a learned latent space, which flexibly scales
  to high-dimensional image observations. We then present a new algorithm, Latent
  Space Safe Sets (LS3), which uses this representation for long-horizon control.
  We evaluate LS3 on 4 domains, including a challenging sequential pushing task in
  simulation and a physical cable routing task. We find that LS3 can use prior task
  successes to restrict exploration and learn more efficiently than prior algorithms
  while satisfying constraints. See https://tinyurl.com/latent-safe-sets for supplementary
