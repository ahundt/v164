abstract: 'In mobile manipulation (MM), robots can both navigate within and interact
  with their environment and are thus able to complete many more tasks than robots
  only capable of navigation or manipulation. In this work, we explore how to apply
  imitation learning (IL) to learn continuous visuo-motor policies for MM tasks. Much
  prior work has shown that IL can train visuo-motor policies for either manipulation
  or navigation domains, but few works have applied IL to the MM domain. Doing this
  is challenging for two reasons: on the data side, current interfaces make collecting
  high-quality human demonstrations difficult, and on the learning side, policies
  trained on limited data can suffer from covariate shift when deployed. To address
  these problems, we first propose Mobile Manipulation RoboTurk (MoMaRT), a novel
  teleoperation framework allowing simultaneous navigation and manipulation of mobile
  manipulators, and collect a first-of-its-kind large scale dataset in a realistic
  simulated kitchen setting. We then propose a learned error detection system to address
  the covariate shift by detecting when an agent is in a potential failure state.
  We train performant IL policies and error detectors from this data, and achieve
  over 45% task success rate and 85% error detection success rate across multiple
  multi-stage tasks when trained on expert data. Additional results and video at https://sites.google.com/view/il-for-mm/home.'
