abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning a repertoire of low-level
  skills from raw images that can be sequenced to complete long-horizon visuomotor
  tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for acquiring short-horizon
  skills autonomously. However, the focus of RL algorithms has largely been on the
  success of those individual skills, more so than learning and grounding a large
  repertoire of skills that can be sequenced to complete extended multi-stage tasks.
  The latter demands robustness and persistence, as errors in skills can compound
  over time, and may require the robot to have a number of primitive skills in its
  repertoire, rather than just one. To this end, we introduce EMBR, a model-based
  RL method for learning primitive skills that are suitable for completing long-horizon
  visuomotor tasks. EMBR learns and plans using a learned model, critic, and success
  classifier, where the success classifier serves both as a reward function for RL
  and as a grounding mechanism to continuously detect if the robot should retry a
  skill when unsuccessful or under perturbations. Further, the learned model is task-agnostic
  and trained using data from all skills, enabling the robot to efficiently learn
  a number of distinct primitives. These visuomotor primitive skills and their associated
  pre- and post-conditions can then be directly combined with off-the-shelf symbolic
  planners to complete long-horizon tasks. On a Franka Emika robot arm, we find that
  EMBR enables the robot to complete three long-horizon visuomotor tasks at 85% success
  rate, such as organizing an office desk, a file cabinet, and drawers, which require
  sequencing up to 12 skills, involve 14 unique learned primitives, and demand generalization
  to novel objects.
