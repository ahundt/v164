abstract: Segmenting unseen object instances in cluttered environments is an important
  capability that robots need when functioning in unstructured environments. While
  previous methods have exhibited promising results, they still tend to provide incorrect
  results in highly cluttered scenes.  We postulate that a network architecture that
  encodes relations between objects at a high-level can be beneficial. Thus, in this
  work, we propose a novel framework that refines the output of such methods by utilizing
  a graph-based representation of instance masks.  We train deep networks capable
  of sampling smart perturbations to the segmentations, and a graph neural network,
  which can encode relations between objects, to evaluate the perturbed segmentations.  Our
  proposed method is orthogonal to previous works and achieves state-of-the-art performance
  when combined with them. We demonstrate an application that uses uncertainty estimates
  generated by our method to guide a manipulator, leading to efficient understanding
  of cluttered scenes. Code, models, and video can be found at https://github.com/chrisdxie/rice.
