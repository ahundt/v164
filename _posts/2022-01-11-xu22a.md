title: 'Look Before You Leap: Safe Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Human Intervention'
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: oqZrUx-PRqb
abstract: Safety has become one of the main challenges of applying deep reinforcement
  learning to real world systems. Currently, the incorporation of external knowledge
  such as human oversight is the only means to prevent the agent from visiting the
  catastrophic state. In this paper, we propose MBHI, a novel framework for safe model-based
  reinforcement learning, which ensures safety in the state-level and can effectively
  avoid both local and non-local catastrophes. An ensemble of supervised learners
  are trained in MBHI to imitate human blocking decisions. Similar to human decision-making
  process, MBHI will roll out an imagined trajectory in the dynamics model before
  executing actions to the environment, and estimate its safety. When the imagination
  encounters a catastrophe, MBHI will block the current action and use an efficient
  MPC method to output a safety policy. We evaluate our method on several safety tasks,
  and the results show that MBHI achieved better performance in terms of sample efficiency
  and number of catastrophes compared to the baselines.
