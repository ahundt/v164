abstract: The basis of many object manipulation algorithms is RGB-D input. Yet, commodity
  RGB-D sensors can only provide distorted depth maps for a wide range of transparent
  objects due light refraction and absorption. To tackle the perception challenges
  posed by transparent objects, we propose TranspareNet, a joint point cloud and depth
  completion method, with the ability to complete the depth of transparent objects
  in cluttered and complex scenes, even with partially filled fluid contents within
  the vessels. To address the shortcomings of existing transparent object data collection
  schemes in literature, we also propose an automated dataset creation workflow that
  consists of robot-controlled image collection and vision-based automatic annotation.
  Through this automated workflow, we created Transparent Object Depth Dataset (TODD),
  which consists of nearly 15000 RGB-D images. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
  that TranspareNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods
  on multiple datasets, including ClearGrasp, and that it also handles cluttered scenes
  when trained on TODD. Code and dataset will be released at https://www.pair.toronto.edu/TranspareNet/
