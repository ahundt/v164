abstract: Overcoming catastrophic forgetting is of great importance for deep learning
  and robotics. Recent lifelong learning research has great advances in supervised
  learning. However, little work focuses on reinforcement learning(RL). We focus on
  evaluating the performances of state-of-the-art lifelong learning algorithms on
  robotic reinforcement learning tasks. We mainly focus on the properties of overcoming
  catastrophic forgetting for these algorithms. We summarize the pros and cons for
  each category of lifelong learning algorithms when applied in RL scenarios. We propose
  a framework to modify supervised lifelong learning algorithms to be compatible with
  RL. We also develop a manipulation benchmark task set for our evaluations.
