title: Anytime Depth Estimation with Limited Sensing and Computation Capabilities
  on Mobile Devices
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: I6DLxqk9J0A
abstract: Depth estimation is a safety critical and energy sensitive method for environment
  sensing. However, in real applications, the depth estimation may be halted at any
  time, due to the random interruptions or low energy capacity of battery when using
  powerful sensors like 3D LiDAR. To address this problem, we propose a depth estimation
  method that is robust to random halts and relies on energy-saving 2D LiDAR and a
  monocular camera. To this end, we formulate the depth estimation as an anytime problem
  and propose a new metric to evaluate its robustness under random interruptions.
  Our final model has only 2M parameters with a marginal accuracy loss compared to
  state-of-the-art baselines. Indeed, our experiments on NYU Depth v2 dataset show
  that our model is capable of processing 224$\times$224 resolution images and 2D
  point clouds with any computation budget larger than 6.37ms (157 FPS) and 0.2J on
  an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 system. Evaluations on KITTI dataset under supervised and self-supervised
  training show similar results.
