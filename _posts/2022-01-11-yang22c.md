abstract: 'We propose a visually-grounded library of behaviors approach for learning
  to manipulate diverse objects across varying initial and goal configurations and
  camera placements. Our key innovation is to disentangle the standard image-to-action
  mapping into two separate modules that use different types of perceptual input:
  (1) a behavior selector which conditions on intrinsic and semantically-rich object
  appearance features to select the behaviors that can successfully perform the desired
  tasks on the object in hand, and (2) a library of behaviors each of which conditions
  on extrinsic and abstract object properties, such as object location and pose, to
  predict actions to execute over time. The selector uses a semantically-rich 3D object
  feature representation extracted from images in a differential end-to-end manner.
  This representation is trained to be view-invariant and affordance-aware using self-supervision,
  by predicting varying views and successful object manipulations. We test our framework
  on pushing and grasping diverse objects in simulation as well as transporting rigid,
  granular, and liquid food ingredients in a real robot setup. Our model outperforms
  image-to-action mappings that do not factorize static and dynamic object properties.
  We further ablate the contribution of the selectorâ€™s input and show the benefits
  of the proposed view-predictive, affordance-aware 3D visual object representations.'
