title: Fast and Efficient Locomotion via Learned Gait Transitions
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: vm8Hr9YJHZ1
abstract: We focus on the problem of developing energy efficient controllers for quadrupedal
  robots. Animals can actively switch gaits at different speeds to lower their energy
  consumption. In this paper, we devise a hierarchical learning framework, in which
  distinctive locomotion gaits and natural gait transitions emerge automatically with
  a simple reward of energy minimization.  We use evolutionary strategies (ES) to
  train a high-level gait policy that specifies gait patterns of each foot, while
  the low-level convex MPC controller optimizes the motor commands so that the robot
  can walk at a desired velocity using that gait pattern. We test our learning framework
  on a quadruped robot and demonstrate automatic gait transitions, from walking to
  trotting and to fly-trotting, as the robot increases its speed. We show that the
  learned hierarchical controller consumes much less energy across a wide range of
  locomotion speed than baseline controllers.
