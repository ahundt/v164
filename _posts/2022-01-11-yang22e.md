title: Motivating Physical Activity via Competitive Human-Robot Interaction
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: s3tu6Ma1jga
abstract: This project aims to motivate research in competitive human-robot interaction
  by creating a robot competitor that can challenge human users in certain scenarios
  such as physical exercise and games. With this goal in mind, we introduce the Fencing
  Game, a human-robot competition used to evaluate both the capabilities of the robot
  competitor and user experience. We develop the robot competitor through iterative
  multi-agent reinforcement learning and show that it can perform well against human
  competitors. Our user study additionally found that our system was able to continuously
  create challenging and enjoyable interactions that significantly increased human
  subjectsâ€™ heart rates. The majority of human subjects considered the system to be
  entertaining and desirable for improving the quality of their exercise.
