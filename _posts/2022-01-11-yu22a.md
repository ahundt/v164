abstract: Vision is one of the essential perception modalities for legged robots to
  safely and efficiently navigate uneven terrains, such as stairs and stepping stones.
  However,  training robots to effectively understand high-dimensional visual input
  for locomotion is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a framework to
  train a vision-based locomotion controller which enables a quadrupedal robot to
  traverse uneven environments. The key idea is to introduce a hierarchical structure
  with a high-level vision policy and a low-level motion controller. The high-level
  vision policy takes as inputs the perceived vision signals as well as robot states
  and outputs the desired footholds and base movement of the robot. These are then
  realized by the low level motion controller composed of a position controller for
  swing legs and a MPC-based torque controller for stance legs. We train the vision
  policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning and demonstrate our approach on a variety
  of uneven environments such as randomly placed stepping stones, quincuncial piles,
  stairs, and moving platforms. We also validate our method on a real robot to walk
  over a series of gaps and climbing up a platform.
