abstract: 'Sequential manipulation tasks require a robot to perceive the state of
  an environment and plan a sequence of actions leading to a desired goal state, where
  the ability to reason about spatial relationships among object entities from raw
  sensor inputs is crucial. Prior works relying on explicit state estimation or end-to-end
  learning struggle with novel objects or new tasks. In this work, we propose SORNet
  (Spatial Object-Centric Representation Network), which extracts object-centric representations
  from RGB images conditioned on canonical views of the objects of interest. We show
  that the object embeddings learned by SORNet generalize zero-shot to unseen object
  entities on three spatial reasoning tasks: spatial relationship classification,
  skill precondition classification and relative direction regression, significantly
  outperforming baselines. Further, we present real-world robotic experiments demonstrating
  the usage of the learned object embeddings in task planning for sequential manipulation.'
