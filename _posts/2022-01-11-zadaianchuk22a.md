title: Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning with Independently Controllable Subgoals
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: TEQWRlncJVm
abstract: 'To successfully tackle challenging manipulation tasks, autonomous agents
  must learn a diverse set of skills and how to combine them. Recently, self-supervised
  agents that set their own abstract goals by exploiting the discovered structure
  in the environment were shown to perform well on many different tasks. In particular,
  some of them were applied to learn basic manipulation skills in compositional multi-object
  environments.  However, these methods learn skills without taking the dependencies
  between objects into account. Thus, the learned skills are difficult to combine
  in realistic environments. We propose a novel self-supervised agent that estimates
  relations between environment components and uses them to independently control
  different parts of the environment state. In addition, the estimated relations between
  objects can be used to decompose a complex goal into a compatible sequence of subgoals.
  We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically
  learn manipulation tasks in multi-object environments with different relations between
  objects. '
