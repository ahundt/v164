title: Single-Shot Scene Reconstruction
section: Contributed Papers
openreview: CGn3XKSf7vf
abstract: We introduce a novel scene reconstruction method to infer a fully editable
  and re-renderable model of a 3D road scene from a single image. We represent movable
  objects separately from the immovable background, and recover a full 3D model of
  each distinct object as well as their spatial relations in the scene. We leverage
  transformer-based detectors and neural implicit 3D representations and we build
  a Scene Decomposition Network (SDN) that reconstructs the scene in 3D. Furthermore,
  we show that this reconstruction can be used in an analysis-by-synthesis setting
  via differentiable rendering. Trained only on simulated road scenes, our method
  generalizes well to real data in the same class without any adaptation thanks to
  its strong inductive priors. Experiments on two synthetic-real dataset pairs (PD-DDAD
  and VKITTI-KITTI) show that our method can robustly recover scene geometry and appearance,
  as well as reconstruct and re-render the scene from novel viewpoints.
