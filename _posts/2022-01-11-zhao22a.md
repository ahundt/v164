abstract: While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has impressive performance in a
  variety of continuous control tasks, one critical hurdle that limits the application
  of DRL to physical world is the lack of safety guarantees. It is challenging for
  DRL agents to persistently satisfy a hard state constraint (known as the safety
  specification) during training. On the other hand, safe control methods with safety
  guarantees have been extensively studied. However, to synthesize safe control, these
  methods require explicit analytical models of the dynamic system; but these models
  are usually not available in DRL. This paper presents a model-free safe control
  strategy to synthesize safeguards for DRL agents, which will ensure zero safety
  violation during training. In particular, we present an implicit safe set algorithm,
  which synthesizes the safety index (also called the barrier certificate) and the
  subsequent safe control law only by querying a black-box dynamic function (e.g.,
  a digital twin simulator). The theoretical results indicate the implicit safe set
  algorithm guarantees forward invariance and finite-time convergence to the safe
  set. We validate the proposed method on the state-of-the-art safety benchmark Safety
  Gym. Results show that the proposed method achieves zero safety violation and gains
  $ 95% \pm 9%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art safe DRL methods. Moreover,
  it can easily scale to high-dimensional systems.
