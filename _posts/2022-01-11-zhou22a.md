abstract: 'As robots are deployed in complex situations, engineers and end users must
  develop a holistic understanding of their behaviors, capabilities, and limitations.
  Some behaviors are directly optimized by the objective function. They often include
  success rate, completion time or energy consumption. Other behaviors – e.g., collision
  avoidance, trajectory smoothness or motion legibility – are typically emergent but
  equally important for safe and trustworthy deployment. Designing an objective which
  optimizes every aspect of robot behavior is hard. In this paper, we advocate for
  systematic analysis of a wide array of behaviors for holistic understanding of robot
  controllers and, to this end, propose a framework, RoCUS, which uses Bayesian posterior
  sampling to find situations where the robot controller exhibits user-specified behaviors,
  such as highly jerky motions. We use RoCUS to analyze three controller classes (deep
  learning models, rapidly exploring random trees and dynamical system formulations)
  on two domains (2D navigation and a 7 degree-of-freedom arm reaching), and uncover
  insights to further our understanding of these controllers and ultimately improve
  their designs. '
