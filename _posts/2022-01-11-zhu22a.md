abstract: Motion forecasting is essential for making safe and intelligent decisions
  in robotic applications such as autonomous driving. Existing methods often formulate
  it as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, solved in an encoder-decoder framework
  with a maximum likelihood estimation objective. State-of-the-art models leverage
  contextual information including the map and states of surrounding agents. However,  we
  observe that they still assign a high probability to unlikely trajectories resulting
  in unsafe behaviors including road boundary violations. Orthogonally, we propose
  a new objective, unlikelihood training, which forces predicted trajectories that
  conflict with contextual information to be assigned a lower probability. We demonstrate
  that our method can improve state-of-art modelsâ€™ performance on challenging real-world
  trajectory forecasting datasets (nuScenes and Argoverse) by avoiding up to 56% context-violated
  prediction and improving up to 9% prediction accuracy. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/UnlikelihoodMotionForecasting
