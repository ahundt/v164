  Shape Representations

abstract: 'This paper proposes a correspondence-free method for point cloud rotational
  registration. We learn an embedding for each point cloud in a feature space that
  preserves the SO(3)-equivariance property, enabled by recent developments in equivariant
  neural networks. The proposed shape registration method achieves three major advantages
  through combining equivariant feature learning with implicit shape models. First,
  the necessity of data association is removed because of the permutation-invariant
  property in network architectures similar to PointNet. Second, the registration
  in feature space can be solved in closed-form using Hornâ€™s method due to the SO(3)-equivariance
  property. Third, the registration is robust to noise in the point cloud because
  of the joint training of registration and implicit shape reconstruction. The experimental
  results show superior performance compared with existing correspondence-free deep
  registration methods.  '
